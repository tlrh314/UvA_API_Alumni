      "description": "<p>Most stars in the Universe are members of double (or multipe) star systems<br />orbiting one another in regular orbits.&nbsp; Such double stars are called<br />binaries.&nbsp; When one of the two stars is a massive star that explodes in a<br />supernova, it is possible for the tremendous explosion to tear apart the<br />binary.&nbsp; In some cases the two stars stay together. Then the result is a<br />binary made up of one normal star and one collapsed star (either neutron<br />star or black hole).&nbsp; Another way in which such a binary can form is when a<br />normal star and an already collapsed star accidentally meet, and capture<br />each other by their gravitational attraction.&nbsp; In either case, when the<br />collapsed star orbits close enough to the ordinary one, gas from the<br />surface of the normal star will be attracted towards the collapsed one and<br />fall onto the surface of the neutron star or into the black hole.&nbsp; This is<br />a violent process in which the gas first swirls around the neutron star or<br />black hole for a while, at speeds of up to more than a hundred thousand<br />kilometers per second, in tighter and tighter orbits.<br /><br />In the process this flow of gas forms a flat disk of very hot plasma<br />emitting copious amounts of radiation of all wavelengths, dominated by<br />X-rays.&nbsp; For this reason such binaries are called X-ray binaries.&nbsp; The<br />neutron stars at the centers of such disks also become very hot, and the<br />swirling gas makes them spin faster and faster, producing X-ray pulses<br />spaced only miiliseconds apart. The black holes, of course, remain black<br />but the radiation from the plasma orbiting them carries the signature of<br />these enigmatic objects and their effects on the surrounding spacetime.<br />This radiation can be observed with astronomical techniques and used to<br />learn about the properties of neutron stars and black holes, and their<br />surroundings.&nbsp; API astronomers use X-ray satellites to observe the<br />radiation from the hot plasma, and optical telescopes to look at the normal<br />stars.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/media/uploads/research/neutron_star_accretion_rotation1.jpg\" alt=\"neutron_star_accretion_rotation\" width=\"252\" height=\"209\" /></p>",

      "description": "<p>While much of what we say here is relevant also for neutron star X-ray binaries (NHXBs), but the following description is specific to black holes (BHs) in particular.</p>\r\n<p>In a black hole X-ray binary (BHB), matter from a normal star is accreted via a stellar wind or Roche lobe overflow into the area of influence of the black hole. In the simplest representation, this accretion process results in the formation of three basic structures around the black hole (BH, see Fig. 1): Due to its angular momentum, the accreted matter forms an accretion disk in which it spirals slowly inwards due to viscosity-induced transfer of angular momentum outwards. The lost gravitational potential energy is thermalized and radiated as a blackbody like spectrum that is detected in the X-ray regime for stellar BHs and in the optical or UV for supermassive BHs. Close to the BH, for reasons which we still do not fully understand, a fraction of the accreted material is ejected outwards, usually at relativistic speeds. The bulk power in these jets can be comparable to the luminosity of the accretion disk, or in some cases even dominate the system luminosity. Finally, the hard X-ray spectra observed from many BHs indicate the need for a third component, the accretion disk corona, where the UV and soft X-rays from the disk or jet are Compton up-scattered in a hot (kT &sim;100 keV in a binary BH) plasma to energies up to several 100 keV.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/media/uploads/research/AGN_XRB_states.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"452\" /></p>\r\n<p>Fig.1: Bottom right: sketch of an X-ray binary with a jet, accretion disk, and compact inner corona. Left and Top right: Radio image (&lambda; = 6 cm, courtesy VLA/NRAO) of the radio galaxy Cygnus A and sketch of an X-ray binary system. Both kinds of system exhibit the same components, however, the mass/size difference of these systems ranges typically over factors of 106-109.</p>\r\n<p>Changes in the radio through &gamma;-ray spectral and timing characteristics are observed on timescales of seconds to months. These changes are thought to result from an interplay of dominance of these components in time and are used to classify BHB behavior into so-called &ldquo;accretion states&rdquo; (see Fig. 2): During the &ldquo;soft state&rdquo;, the X-ray spectrum of the source is well described by an accretion disk spectrum, the source shows only weak X-ray variability, and radio emission from the jet is non-detectable. During the &ldquo;hard state&rdquo;, on the other hand, the X-ray spectrum is a non-thermal power-law with an exponential cut-off extending to &gt;150 keV and strong radio emission is observed. During &ldquo;intermediate states&rdquo; between these states, the X-ray spectrum softens and intermittent radio flaring is observed. &nbsp;While some BHBs remain in one state for most of the time (e.g., Cygnus X-1, the first BH discovered,&nbsp;is mainly a hard state source), most BHBs are found in transient systems. These&nbsp;transients are typically quiescent at least 90% of the time, but have week to decades long outbursts during which they can reach luminosities as high as the Eddington luminosity &ndash; the luminosity at which the radiation pressure generated by the accretion process can disrupt the accretion flow itself.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/media/uploads/research/HIdiagram_states.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"433\" /></p>\r\n<p>Fig. 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardness intensity diagram of the BHB GX 339&minus;4 during a 525 day long outburst. Each dot is the average of a day&rsquo;s observations. The main accretion states are noted. &nbsp;The schematics show roughly our best sense of the interplay between the accretion disk, accretion disk corona, and jet.</p>\r\n<p>The behavior of these transient sources during the outburst illustrates well the interplay between the&nbsp;different components making up the multi-wavelength spectrum of BHBs. This behavior is best shown in terms of an hardness intensity diagram (HID) such as Fig. 2, in which the source luminosity is plotted against the X-ray&nbsp;spectral shape (&ldquo;soft&rdquo; meaning thermal, &ldquo;hard&rdquo; meaning a power law continuum). In such a diagram, sources start the outburst in the lower right corner and follow a counter-clockwise&nbsp;q-shaped path in the HID, transiting to different accretion states along the way. &nbsp;Jets are only detected in the hard and intermediate&nbsp;state. Hard state jets are less relativistic and more continuous, yet still dominate the power output compared to the accretion disk, while jets during the intermediate state are faster, can show apparent superluminal motion,&nbsp;and have discrete ejecta.</p>\r\n<p>In order to properly reconstruct the physical mechanisms underlying the observed emission properties, however, one needs to have detailed physical models to compare against both spectral and timing&nbsp;data. Although available observations have already helped in forging a rough understanding of the&nbsp;interplay of the disk, accretion disk corona, and jets, our ability to derive the detailed physics of BH&nbsp;accretion is inhibited by our limited understanding of all of these components, as well as the exact&nbsp;nature of their relationship to each other.</p>\r\n<p>The critical questions currently under debate are:</p>\r\n<p>1. Fundamental Properties of the Accretion Flow: How does matter accrete through the accretion disk? What triggers outburst&nbsp;cycles, and how? What is the actual accretion rate, and how does that drive state changes? How do accretion flows form coronae and atmospheres, and what is the final geometry of the cooler/hotter phases of accretion?&nbsp;How do accretion disks radiate? Does accretion&nbsp;disk emission from a BH allow us to test GR in the strong field limit?</p>\r\n<p>2. Fundamental Properties of Jet Outflows: How, why and under what conditions are jets formed?&nbsp;Are jets powered mainly via the accretion flow or BH spin? How are jets accelerated and collimated? Do jets contain mostly matter or electromagnetic fields, and is the matter mostly hadronic or leptonic? How are particles accelerated in the jets? What are the physical and formational differences between the two types of&nbsp;jets observed in galactic BHs? What are the neutrino production mechanisms in jets?</p>\r\n<p>3. Black Holes and Other Compact Objects: What are the differences in the accretion flows onto black holes and neutron stars? Does the physics of accretion scale predictably from BHBs, via intermediate mass&nbsp;BHs, to the supermassive BHs in the centers of galaxies? How to accretion states in BHBs relate to the different classes observed in Active Galactic Nuclei? &nbsp;What is the impact of BHs on the larger environment?</p>\r\n<p>Here at the API we are actively involved in pursuing answers for all of the above topics, and our groups include both observational and theoretical efforts.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The space inbetween the stars is not empty, but filled with a mixture of gas and dust called the interstellar medium (ISM). The ISM in our galaxy contains enough mass to continuously for new stars, while older stars donate mass back to the ISM enriching it with the heavier elements that we find on earth today, but were not present after the Big Bang. Although the dust of the ISM contains only 1% of its mass, it can be observed in the infrared through all stages of its life-cycle.</p>\r\n<p>Dust first forms in the outer layers of dying and evolved stars such as planetary nebulae and AGb stars. It is mixed into the ISM, where it resides as the diffuse ISM or more dense molecular clouds. The latter are also the sites of star formation, completing the life cycle of dust in the ISM. During and after the star formation process, dust can be found in protoplanetary disks - where planetary systems are formed - and in debris disks, the remnants of planet formation.<br /><br />Through all these stages, the dust can be observed at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths, with space-based telescopes such as Spitzer and Herschel, but also ground-based facilites such as the VLT. The ISM group in Amsterdam is traditionally strong in mid and far infrared spectroscopy, which is an excellent tool to study the mineralogy of dust in different stages of its evolution, as well as trace the underlying physical processes of the environments they are found in: AGB stars, protoplanetary and debris disks.<br /><br /><img src=\"/media/uploads/research/060807_life_cycle_02.jpg\" alt=\"life cycle\" width=\"575\" height=\"575\" /></p>\r\n<p>Fig. 1: The life cycle of interstellar dust. credit: Bill Saxton, NRAO/AUI/NSF<br /><br /></p>",

      "category": 2, 
      "description": "<p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous explosions known to man. They are unique physics laboratories in which the radiation is produced in ultra-relativistic outflows, traveling with bulk Lorentz factors of hundreds and harboring extreme particle acceleration, something hard to produce elsewhere in the Universe let alone in laboratories here on Earth. GRBs are thought to originate in massive stars, either through the collapse of a massive, rapidly rotating star, or from the merger of two compact objects such as neutron stars or black holes. This progenitor division appears visible in observations by the duration and spectral properties of the actual burst of gamma-rays itself, and by the placement of the burst with respect to the centre of their host galaxy. With their origin in massive stars and visible from enormous distances (redshifts of more than 8 have been measured), GRBs are an invaluable tool to probe star formation across the ages, but they can also be used as a backlight for observations of their host and intervening galaxies.</p>\r\n<p>Amsterdam has been a long-time center for research into GRBs, mainly their afterglows, which is the broadband radiation across the whole electromagnetic spectrum produced after the initial gamma-ray event. The first optical afterglow was discovered in Amsterdam in 1997, and one year later the connection between GRBs and supernovae was also discovered in Amsterdam (which confirmed their origin in massive stars). Researchers at the Anton Pannekoek Institute, also as part of large international collaborations, have continued to contribute significantly to the GRB field with observations of their host galaxies and afterglows at radio, optical and X-ray frequencies, and theoretical studies of the relativistic outflows and emission processes giving rise to these enigmatic events.</p>\r\n<p>The research on GRBs in Amsterdam currently focuses on the following topics:</p>\r\n<p>- The optical spectra obtained from afterglows, which provide a wealth of information on the direct surroundings of the GRBs and their host galaxies. For this research we mainly perform observations with the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma and the new-generation X-Shooter spectropgraph on the Very Large Telescope in Chili. The emission and absorption lines in their spectra reveal the redshifts and metallicities of the host galaxies, and high-resolution spectroscopy provides unique information on the effects that GRBs have on the dust in their immediate environments.</p>\r\n<p>- Broadband modeling of GRB afterglows, using observations at radio, millimeter, infrared, optical and X-ray frequencies, which sheds light on the macro- and microphysical processes that are playing a role in the relativistic outflows causing the radiation that is observed. The parameters that are derived include the energetics and collimation of the outflow, the density and structure of the circumburst medium, and the magnetic field strength and energy in the relativistic electrons which are producing the observed radiation. These physical parameters give insight in the amount of energy produced in the collapse of massive stars or compact binary mergers, particle acceleration and magnetic field generation.</p>\r\n<p>- Radio observations of GRBs with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and in the near future with the new-generation Low Frequency Array. These observations provide unique information to constrain the physical parameters by following the behaviour until much later times than any other wavelength, sometimes even for years. At these late times the outflow is not relativistic anymore and the true energetics can be determined free of any relativistic effects. The radio band is also used to search for off-axis emission from a spreading GRB outflow that is originally pointed away from us in some particular supernovae.</p>\r\n<p>- Modeling the evolution of the relativistic outflow using detailed hydrodynamics and radiation codes, which forms the basis to understand the kinematics that go into the explosion. While the traditional afterglow modeling adopts several simplifications, these studies use powerful computers to determine the evolution of the outflow and the observed radiation in great detail, taking into account for instance the structure of the outflow and the surrounding medium, and the angle under which the collimated outflow is observed.</p>\r\n<p>-- The progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts and their effects on the observed gamma-ray and afterglow emission. Short GRBs are thought to originate in the merger of two neutron stars or a neutron star and black hole, but the end product of that merger is unclear. It is predicted that an unstable millisecond pulsar with an extremely high magnetic field is formed, which will then collapse into a black hole. The imprint of this so-called millisecond magnetar is being investigated, mainly with gamma- and X-rays that are observed at early times.</p>",

Shocks and possibly magnetic reconnection result in the acceleration of particles to very high energies, with the the distribution of energies being non-thermal, often following quasi power-law distribution.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from detecting them as cosmic rays on Earth, these relativistic particles can also be studied in the highly energetic sources where they are produced, and in the interstellar medium through which they may subsequently propagate, through the electro-magnetic and neutrino signals they produce.</p>\r\n<p>The best studied electro-magnetic signal is synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons and positrons interacting with magnetic fields. Synchrotron radiation is one of the most important signals in the radio domain, and can be studied with radio-telescopes such as, in the Netherlands, the Westerbork radio-synthesis telescope and LOFAR. The highest energy electrons/positrons produce synchrotron radiation in X-rays.</p>\r\n<p>The same electron/positron populations that produce synchrotron radiation also produce signals with higher frequencies. The relativistic electrons can also scatter background photons, which then gain energy, and can be detected as gamma-rays. The background photons are usually part of the cosmic microwave background, but could also find its origin stellar light, or even come from the source itself. Electrons/Positrons also produce gamma-rays by interacting with charged particles, a process called bremsstrahlung (or free-free emission).</p>\r\n<p>The cosmic rays observed on Earth consist for 99% of protons and other atomic nuclei. Also these produces signals: collisions of these particles with background atoms leads to the production of new particles, in particular so-called pions.

The &pi;<sup>0</sup> decays almost immediately in two photons, which we can observe as gamma-rays with energies in excess of 100 MeV. The charged pions (&pi;<sup>+</sup>, &pi;<sup>-</sup>) decay into muons and neutrinos, with the muons decaying into electrons/positrons and additional neutrinos. The electrons/positrons will in principle produce radiation as well, but of interests are also the neutrinos, as they can be detected by giant neutrino detectors such as KM3NeT and IceCube.</p>\r\n<p>The combination of all these signals (radio, X-ray, gamma-rays and neutrinos) can be used to study the sources of cosmic rays, and the physics of the acceleration process.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/media/uploads/research/hess.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"531\" /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Even during their short life-time, they lose a sizeable fraction of their initial mass. The Wolf-Rayet stage is indeed thought to result from the progressive evaporation of the star atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p>Because of their extreme properties, early-type stars largely influence their surroundings. They are the first source of ionizing photons in the Universe and, as such, are thought to be at the origin of the large-scale HII regions. Through their winds and their dramatic end as supernovae, their influence is also mechanical. For example, their winds are so powerful that they can shape the ambient medium, resulting in spectacular wind-blown bubbles. The massive stars are also the main cause of chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium, especially in heavy elements that are mostly produced during the last stages of their evolution and during the supernova phase. Beyond their influence on their host galaxy, high-mass stars are further important for a number of extragalactic and cosmological issues. For example, they have been proposed to serve as cosmic candles thanks to the Wind-Momentum-Luminosity relation and the first generation of massive stars might have been responsible for the reionisation of the early Universe.</p>\r\n<p>However, despite the progresses made over the last decades, many crucial issues are still lacking satisfactory answers.

      "description": "<p>Massive stars are an important component in the evolution of galaxies. However, little is known about their formation process. Low-mass stars are known to form through accretion of material from circumstellar protoplanetary disks. This scenario cannot be extrapolated to higher masses, because the material will then accrete so rapidly, that the radiation from the growing star will already blow away the accretion disk at an early stage. In this way, stars can never become more massive than a few solar masses. Yet, more massive stars do exist, so somehow they must overcome this `radiation pressure' problem. Current lines of research are focused on modeling massive accretion disks in order to understand how nature circumvents the radiation pressure problem, and by exploring alternatives to the disk formation scenario.</p>\r\n<p>Definitive progress can be made with actual observations of massive star formation. Hoewever, observations are difficult for three reasons: the relative rarity of massive stars (less than 10% of the observed stars are massive), their short lifetime, and the obscuration of their birth places by dust clouds. Because of the last aspect, observations have hitherto mainly been of radiation that can pierce through these clouds, namely infrared and radio observations.</p>\r\n<p>At the API, we use data from various state-of-the-art observatories to clue us in on this mysterious formation process. In particular, the newly made optical-to-infrared spectrograph X-shooter on the Very Large Telescope in Chile is being used to observe newly born massive stars.

This is the approach that is used by <a href=\"http://www.geo.mtu.edu/UPSeis/waves.html\"> geologists and geophysicists</a>, for example, to figure out the interior structure of the Earth. Studying the effect of starquakes on neutron stars if of course rather harder (since we can't go and place a seismometer on the star's surface!) but the telltale signs of starquakes can be seen by studying the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the star. We are studying starquakes on a particular class of neutron stars called <a href=\"http://solomon.as.utexas.edu/%7Eduncan/magnetar.html\">magnetars</a>, which have very strong magnetic fields. These strong fields get tangled up and reconnect, launching strong gamma-ray flares, in a process similar to that which launches solar flares. As the magnetic field lines twist and snap they can set the star vibrating. By studying the frequencies of the vibrations excited by the flares, we can figure out the properties of the star's interior - such as the <a href=\"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060501_mm_starquake.html\">thickness of the star's solid crust.</a> This tells us how matter behaves when it is crushed to extreme pressures.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/media/uploads/research/nsquake_png_versions/medium_nsquake.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" /></p>\r\n<p>Fig. 1: A neutron star that has been been set into vibration by a starquake (Image credit: Anna Watts)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "description": "<p>Protoplanetary disks are the main sites of planet formation. The are found around young stars, and contain the necessary building blocks to form planetary systems. They are essentially a by-product of star formation: when stars form in collapsing cores of molecular clouds, angular momentum prevents all the gas and dust to end up on in the star. It ends up orbiting the new-formed star, forming a protoplanetary disks. The disk is dispersed in a few million years, setting the timescale for planet formation.<br /><br />Observations of disks are plenty. However challenging, they can be imaged directly in scattered starlight, in thermal mid-infrared emission or with interferometers at (sub)-millimeter wavelengths to study their geometry. With mid and far infrared spectroscopy we can study the composition and evolution of dust, as well as trace some of the gas that governs the disk dynamics. Additionally, broad-band spectral energy distributions of large numbers of disks are available, allowing for characterizations of protoplanetary disks at different stages of their evolution.<br /><br />Research on this topic in Amsterdam is mostly focussed on Herbig Ae and Be stars, young stars of 2-8 solar mass. Because they are more luminous, their disks can be studied in great detail. The recent discovery of giant planets orbiting main-sequence A stars supports the interpretation that these disks are forming planets, similar to their sun-like counterparts, T-Tauri stars. The signposts of planet formation, such as the appearance of disk gaps and growth of dust grains, can be identified in these disks and be used to study the first stages of planet formation.<br /><br /><img src=\"/media/uploads/research/fomalhardy_jpg_versions/medium_fomalhardy.jpg\" alt=\"planet formation\" width=\"460\" height=\"339\" /></p>\r\n<p>Fig. 1: Artist impression of planet formation in a protoplanetary disk. credit: David Hardy</p>",

      "category": 2, 
      "description": "<p>Supernovae are the most explosive events in normal galaxies and they occur quite regular; our own Galaxy is thought to have a supernova rate of 2-3 per century. Supernovae come in two main flavors: core collapse supernovae and thermonuclear (or Type Ia) supernovae.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/media/uploads/research/supernova-galaxy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"550\" /></p>\r\n<p>Core collapse supernovae are the explosions of the most massive stars (&gt; 8Msun on the main sequence). There explosion energy comes from the gravitational energy released when the stellar core can no longer support the gravitational pressure and collapses. Most of the implosion energy (10^53 erg/10^46 J) is released in the form of neutrinos, but about 1% is used for disrupting the remainder of the star. The imploded core remains as a neutron star, or in some cases as a stellar mass black hole. The ejected stellar material is rich in oxygen and other alpha elements, but also contains some iron-group elements.<br /><br />Thermonuclear/Type Ia supernovae Ia are exploding carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, which explode because, as their mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, the pressure increases, and carbon-oxygen ignites. This results in runaway nuclear fusion reactions, disrupting the star.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the source of energy is very different from that of core collapse supernovae, the total kinetic energy of thermonuclear supernovae is very similar: 1051 erg. It is still not clear why the central density pressure increases. Is it caused by accretion from a normal stellar companion, or is it caused by the merging of two white dwarfs? Type Ia supernovae result in the production of mainly iron-group elements, about 0.7 solar masses per explosion.<br /><br />Both types of supernovae eject a large mass of recently synthesized elements into the interstellar/circumstellar medium, with a kinetic energy of 10^51 erg/10^44 J, and velocities up to 10,000-20,000 km/s. This results in a shock wave in the interstellar/circumstellar medium, which heats up the gas to temperatures of 10^7-10^8 Kelvin and pushes this hot plasma into a shell. In this process the supernova material also gets heated to similar temperatures. At these temperatures the hot plasma emits copious X-ray emission, with prominent X-ray line emission indicating the composition of the material ejected by the supernova. As more material is shock-heated the velocity of the shock decreases, and the<br />average temperature of the plasma declines. After 50,000-100,000 years the large supernova remnant shell hardly emits X-rays anymore, and slowly the shell disappears. In the early phases supernova remnants are of interest as they can be used to study the composition and energy of the supernova material.<br /><br />The supernova remnants shocks are also of interest as these are sites of particle acceleration. It is generally thought that during the first 1000-10,000 yr particles can be accelerated by the shock to energies as high as 10^15 eV. These particles escape the shells and collectively are called cosmic rays. Cosmic rays penetrate the solar system and we detect them as they bombard the Earth atmosphere. While being accelerated by the supernova remnants shocks, the cosmic-rays interact with the local plasma and magnetic fields and emit radiation all across the electro-magnetic spectrum. Studying this radiation reveals where and how cosmic rays are produced.<br /><br /><img src=\"/media/uploads/research/supernova.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"550\" /></p>",

      "description": "<p>The evolution and the total lifetime of stars depend strongly on  the initial mass. Since the processes that govern the evolution of low,  intermediate and high mass stars are very different, those fields are  distinct specific areas of research inside the broader topic of stellar  evolution. The Red Giant Branch (RGB) and the Asymptotic Giant Branch  (AGB) are two of the later stages of intermediate mass stars (with  masses between 0.8 and 8 times the mass of the Sun) life.</p>\r\n<p>During all of their lives, stars need to produce energy to generate enough pressure to balance the gravity force (that compresses the star). Although, the main energy source changes during stellar evolution, one (or more, sometimes) is always needed, in order to reach an equilibrium situation. A star is said to be born when Hydrogen starts to be burned into Helium in the core, this is called the Main Sequence (MS) phase. The burning of Hydrogen is the most important energy source during the stellar life and intermediate mass stars will stay on the MS for billions of year in average.</p>\r\n<p>When there is no more Hydrogen left in the core, the structure of the star changes, since equilibrium cannot be reached in the MS configuration anymore. Intermediate mass stars will experience two ascents into the, so called, giant branch after leaving the MS. The name giant given to this period is due the very big sizes and very large luminosity that they present.</p>\r\n<p>During the ascent on the RGB, the star gradually increases in size and luminosity. In the core, constituted basically of Helium, no nuclear burning happens. The energy is obtained by burning Hydrogen around the core in a thin layer. The star will only stop increasing in size, and, therefore, leave the RGB, when the temperature in the core is high enough so that Helium burning can take place. Then, another phase of very stable core burning (similar to the MS) starts but in this case, Helium is the fuel. This phase is referred to as the Horizontal Branch and it lasts for around 10% of the time spent on the MS.</p>\r\n<p>A very similar process happens when Helium is exhausted in the center and the star experiences again a gradual increase in both size and luminosity. The AGB starts and it is one of the very last stages of intermediate stars evolution. Stars in this phase are very luminous (~10000 brighter than the Sun) and large (~ 100 larger than the Sun) but have a low temperature (around half the temperature of the Sun). The low temperature of this objects is translates into a red color for the emitted light, and this can be used to identify them. Due to the characteristics of their envelopes, they also present a slow (~ 10 km/s) wind, that corresponds to very high mass loss rates (10<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>-4</sup> solar masses per year), and through which they enrich the Interstellar medium with the ashes of their nuclear burning.</p>\r\n<p>In the expanding wind, molecules and dust grains are formed. The dust absorbs the stellar radiation and becomes warm (~ 1000 K), being detected in the Spectral Energy Distribution of AGB stars due to excess infrared radiation. The molecules produce absorption or emission lines and also provide an important probe of the physical conditions of the wind.</p>\r\n<p>AGB objects are very important contributors for the chemical evolution of galaxies. Therefore, a good understanding of the mass ejection mechanism and element abundance of the wind is essential for understanding chemical evolution in the Universe.</p>\r\n<p>However, we are not yet capable of predicting the evolution of a star in the AGB given its physical parameters, due to the very complex processes that happen during this phase. And a lot of effort is put into trying to connect the observed properties with models for stellar evolution, wind acceleration, envelope chemistry, dust nucleation and growth, radiative transfer and so on.</p>\r\n<p>Besides studying the physical properties of the wind through models of dust and molecular emission, a lot can be learned from studying the pulsation properties of RGB and AGB stars. Parameters usually very difficult to access can be determined in this way. The science that studies the internal structure of pulsating stars by the interpretation of their frequency spectra is called Asteroseismology.</p>\r\n<p>Different oscillation modes penetrate to different depths inside the star. These oscillations provide information about the otherwise unobservable interiors of stars in a manner similar to how seismologists study the interior of Earth and other solid planets through the use of earthquake oscillations.</p>\r\n<p>In red-giant stars ascending the red-giant branch and in the horizontal branch or red clump, so-called solar-like oscillations have been observed. Solar-like oscillations are stochastically excited by the turbulent outer layers in these stars, similar to the oscillations observed in the Sun. From these oscillations it is possible to derive masses, radii and evolutionary states of the stars. <br /> For the analyses data from the French-led CoRoT satellite and NASA Kepler satellite are used.</p>\r\n<p>Active fields of research are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Determining individual frequencies of the oscillation modes through so-called peakbagging to investigate excitation and damping mechanism.</li>\r\n<li>Extending the research to more evolved (AGB) stars and investigate possible connections between these oscillations and mass-loss.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Extending the research to subgiants to investigate the rapid stellar interior changes in that evolutionary phase.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Due to the high densities and temperatures, the accreted matter undergoes thermonuclear reactions. Under some circumstances this burning process is unstable and causes an entire surface layer to ignite, resulting in an intense flash of X-ray emission that temporarily outshines the X-ray binary's accretion luminosity. Such thermonuclear X-ray bursts have a typical duration of a few seconds to a minute, although on some occasions X-ray bursts with a duration of tens of minutes, hours or even up a day have been seen.
