      "text": "<p>The Netherlands Research School for Astronomy (NOVA), as part of its&nbsp;research program Formation and evolution of stars and planetary&nbsp;systems, plans to start a PhD project at the University of Amsterdam&nbsp;focused on the formation and early evolution of the most massive&nbsp;stars.</p>\r\n<p>The mechanism by which the most massive stars form is poorly&nbsp;understood. Even though they are the most luminous objects in the&nbsp;Galaxy, their formation process and early evolution are obscured from&nbsp;view due to the tens to hundreds of magnitudes of (visual)&nbsp;extinction. Near-infrared imaging and spectroscopic surveys of&nbsp;high-mass star-forming regions reveal an amazingly complex interplay&nbsp;between the star formation process and the environment. K-band&nbsp;spectroscopy has resulted in the identification of young OB-type stars&nbsp;deeply embedded in (ultra-)compact H II regions, some of them still&nbsp;surrounded by a remnant accretion disk.</p>\r\n<p>The key questions are: How are the most massive stars formed? What are&nbsp;the physical properties of the newly formed stars (photospheric&nbsp;parameters, rotational characteristics, radiation-driven wind, remnant&nbsp;accretion disks, binarity)? What is causing the lifetime problem (100x&nbsp;more UCHIIs than predicted by the current star formation rate)? Is the&nbsp;observed large range in spectral/photometric properties due to just a&nbsp;difference in mass (thus timescale), and/or does the environment play&nbsp;an important role?</p>\r\n<p>Our strategy will be to extend the covered wavelength range of the&nbsp;many candidate young massive stars in our large survey down from the&nbsp;near-infrared into the optical (red) domain, thereby directly probing&nbsp;the stellar photosphere and wind. Optical/nIR spectra will be obtained&nbsp;within the VLT/X-shooter GTO program. &nbsp;With VLT/CRIRES the CO bandhead&nbsp;emission will be studied at high spectral resolution, allowing&nbsp;detailed modeling of the remnant accretion disk around the massive&nbsp;YSOs. A study of several star-forming regions has been carried out&nbsp;with VLT/SINFONI and Spitzer, to obtain a full census of their stellar&nbsp;content, ionized material, and outflows. One of the goals of the&nbsp;project is to relate the found results to observations obtained at&nbsp;longer wavelengths (e.g. VLA, ALMA) that likely probe an even earlier&nbsp;phase in the star formation process. Reduction, analysis, and&nbsp;interpretation of the obtained data, including the collection of new&nbsp;data, will form a major part of the project that should lead to a PhD&nbsp;at the University of Amsterdam. &nbsp;The position is offered for a period&nbsp;of 4 years and should be taken up in the Fall of 2009. The salary will&nbsp;be on the standard Dutch university scale.</p>\r\n<p>Interested candidates should have a Master degree in astronomy or&nbsp;physics (or the equivalent). Applications should contain a curriculum&nbsp;vitae, a statement of research experience and interest, and the names&nbsp;of two references, to be sent to:</p>\r\n<p>Review of the applications will start on September 7, 2009, and&nbsp;continue until the position is filled.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "text": "<h3>Unravelling the physical and chemical structure of the stellar winds in AGB stars</h3>\r\n<p>A PhD position is available at the Astronomy Institute in Amsterdam, for research on the physical and chemical structure of the stellar winds in AGB stars.</p>\r\n<h4>Background</h4>\r\n<p>The late stages of stellar evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) are characterized by prodigious mass loss via a molecular, dusty wind. These winds dominate the final phases of the star and are important in the cycle of mass in galaxies. Understanding these stellar winds, their chemistry and time variation is one of the challenges of present-day AGB research. Recent observational studies of the mass loss history of AGB stars using both dust and gas give puzzling results, that suggest that the structure of these winds is not understood. For instance, the dust which condenses in the outflow is believed to be important in driving the stellar wind, but at present there is no good understanding of the importance of dust in driving oxygen-rich outflows. A possible alternative for driving the winds is radiation pressure on gas. Molecules such as CO and water are important coolants of the gas flow, and their rich infrared and millimeter spectra can be used to probe the physical and chemical structure of the outflow.</p>\r\n<h4>The project</h4>\r\n<p><img  title=\"Hershel\" src=\"/media/uploads/jobs/Herschel.jpg\" alt=\"Herschel Telescope\" width=\"300\" height=\"257\" />In May of 2009, the ESA HERSCHEL Space Observatory was launched successfully, with three scientific instruments on board. The HIFI instrument on board of HERSCHEL will be used to study a large sample of AGB stars within the context of the approved guaranteed time key programme HIFISTARS. The project focuses on an observational analysis of molecular line observations (mainly of CO and water) that will be obtained using HIFI; these data will be combined with data taken in the context of other approved HERSCHEL programmes using the HERSCHEL PACS instrument and with archival data at other wavelengths to obtain a comprehensive view of the physical and chemical structure of AGB winds.</p>\r\n<p>A significant part of the thesis work will involve modeling the HIFI and PACS observations using state of the art radiative transfer models developed at the Institute of Astronomy of Leuven University by Dr. Leen Decin. The project will thus involve close collaboration with the Leuven institute, as well as with the HIFI expertise centre at Groningen.</p>\r\n<h4>The position</h4>\r\n<p>The position offered is a four year PhD limited term position funded through a NWO \"vrije competitie\" grant. The research will be conducted at the Astronomical Institute \"Anton Pannekoek\" of the University of Amsterdam, in close collaboration with the Institute for Astronomy of Leuven University, Belgium. Supervisors will be Prof.Dr. Rens Waters and Dr. Leen Decin. Salaries will be commensurate to the standard scale for PhD students at the University of Amsterdam. The candidate is expected to contribute to the teaching of astronomy courses at the University of Amsterdam.</p>\r\n<h4>Interested?</h4>\r\n<p>The successful candidate must have a master degree in astrophysics, physics or equivalent.

Metallic Fe plays a key role in the condensation of solid particles in the outflows of evolved stars, and is a main source of opacity in solid material. In interstellar space Fe remains in the solid phase and may take part in the formation of new solids, such as FeS.  While FeS is found to be abundan in solar system material, the formation of solid Fe  and the possible role of metallic Fe in this process - important because FeS is the dominant source of sulphur in our solar system - is currently not understood. In order to address these issues, gas phase IR spectroscopy of iron and iron sulphide nanoclusters will be conducted using the free electron laser FELIX. The optical properties of these clusters will be investigated by application of UV/VIS spectroscopy. These laboratory data will then be compared to astronomical observations and applied todust grain models in order to investigate the physics and chemistry of Fe in solids in space. The first, experimental part of the research will be conducted using the FELIX free electron laser, currently located at the FOM institute in Nieuwegein and soon to become part of the new F-cube FEL facility at the Radboud University in Nijmegen. The latter part of the thesis work will be located at the University of Amsterdam.

The Netherlands is also involved in phase-A studies for multi-object spectrograph concepts on 4-8m-class telescopes (WEAVE on the WHT La Palma, 4MOST on VISTA, and MOONS on the VLT). These projects share several work packages and are relevant for the future development of an E-ELT MOS.</p>\r\n<p>The post-doc position is intended to perform astronomical and technical trade-offs for E-ELT instrumentation in general and OPTIMOS-EVE in particular, in preparation for phase B. The functional description is comparable to that of instrument scientist.

Important technical aspects relate to the fiber coupling into the spectrograph, i.e. how this affects the overall efficiency, sky-background correction, the application of dichroics, and the use of VPH gratings (in the near-infrared and the trade-off with respect to conventionally ruled gratings).</p>\r\n<p>The FNWI faculty has recently moved to a new building and offers a stimulating research environment with excellent infrastructure.

By studying the properties of a wide variety of systems (active binaries, accreting compact objects, milli-second pulsars) we gain a better picture of the dynamical processes that are active in different environments as well as the physical processes at work in those binary systems.",

Dynamical&nbsp;encounters between cluster stars can create exotic binaries that are&nbsp;very rare in the field, but they can also lead to binary destruction,&nbsp;resulting in a dearth of certain classes of systems that are typically&nbsp;relatively common. Such interacting binaries are bright sources of&nbsp;X-ray emission. Thanks to the sensitivity and sharp view of the&nbsp;Chandra X-ray Observatory we can now start studying in detail the&nbsp;balance between forming and breaking up binaries by comparing the&nbsp;properties of cluster and field binary populations. This project will&nbsp;take the vantage point of the latter, and focuses on those binary&nbsp;classes that so far have received little attention due to their low&nbsp;X-ray luminosities (~1e32 erg/s or less), including&nbsp;magnetically-active binaries. The work is (initially) mainly&nbsp;observationally oriented, and the successful applicant will have the&nbsp;opportunity to apply for, gather, and analyze both ground-based and&nbsp;satellite data (e.g. from Chandra, and the Hubble Space Telescope).</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>2. &nbsp;Models of extrasolar planets and disks for studies in polarized light</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Supervisor: Carsten Dominik (UvA)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Co-supervisors: Christoph Keller (Leiden), Matthew Kenworthy (Leiden)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">An internal consortium is currently building a new instrument for the Very Large Telescope in Chile: &nbsp;The SPHERE instrument is an extreme adaptive optics instrument designed for high contrast imaging, for discovery and study of extrasolar planets and circumstellar disks. &nbsp;Together with a group at the ETH in Z&uuml;rich, we are building the optical polarimeter ZIMPOL. &nbsp;The PhD student will further develop polarized radiative transfer codes to explain the upcoming ZIMPOL measurements of proto-planetary disks and mature/cold gas giant exoplanets, making use of the world-leading expertise in the Netherlands. By 2014, SPHERE science data will be collected, and a first-order characterization of gas giants will be possible by measuring their intensity and linear polarization at a few wavelengths. The PhD student will focus on modeling signals by adapting existing models of gas planet atmospheres and (polarized) radiative transfer and polarized spectrum codes, to explain the SPHERE observations as well as spectropolarimetric observations of solar-system gas planets. These codes together will provide a data retrieval package that will allow us to quantitatively understand the atmospheres of mature/cold gas exoplanets. &nbsp;In addition, the student will also work on radiative transfer models of circumstellar disks, another key aspect of research with SPHERE/ZIMPOL.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>3. &nbsp;LOTAAS: The LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey for Pulsars and Fast Transients</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Supervisor: Jason Hessels (ASTRON/UvA)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Co-Supervisors:&nbsp;J. van Leeuwen (ASTRON/UvA), R. Wijers (UvA), H. Falcke (Nijmegen) &amp; M. van der Klis (UvA)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The successful PhD candidate will work on `LOTAAS', an all-northern-sky survey for pulsars and fast&nbsp;transients using the LOFAR high-band antennas. &nbsp;LOTAAS will take&nbsp;advantage of LOFAR's unparalleled field-of-view and multi-beaming&nbsp;capabilities to perform the deepest all-sky survey ever undertaken for&nbsp;pulsars and any other radio pulses with sub-second durations. &nbsp;The&nbsp;survey is in many ways different from previous pulsar surveys (e.g.,&nbsp;much longer dwell times and lower frequency) and the potential for the&nbsp;serendipitous discovery of new source classes and physical phenomena&nbsp;is high, especially because of the unprecedented `total on-sky' time the survey will achieve. &nbsp;We have demonstrated the technical feasibility and&nbsp;scientific potential of LOTAAS through two pilot surveys performed&nbsp;during LOFAR's commissioning period and have recently started acquiring data for this all-sky survey. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>4. &nbsp;The formation and early evolution of the most massive stars</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Supervisor: Lex Kaper (UvA)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The recent development of sensitive spectroscopic techniques at near-infrared wavelengths allows for the&nbsp;first time direct detections and quantitative analysis of characteristics of massive proto-stars. These so-called&nbsp;massive Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) must represent a later phase of formation than the luminous extended&nbsp;disk sources that can be detected at (sub-) millimeter wavelengths, though it is unclear at the moment how&nbsp;these two phases are related. In this project we will study the physical link between these two, likely&nbsp;sequential, phases of massive star formation by combining ALMA and near-IR imaging and spectroscopy of&nbsp;star-forming regions in the Milky Way and Local Group galaxies, in particular the Magellanic Clouds.&nbsp;Such a multi-wavelength approach will allow us to study massive star formation in an environmental&nbsp;context, including aspects of metallicity and cluster mass/density. By establishing the physical properties of&nbsp;the newly formed stars &ndash; such as photospheric parameters, binary properties, rotational characteristics,&nbsp;ionizing fluxes, and radiation-driven winds &ndash; we will assess the importance of feedback from this new&nbsp;population on the star formation process in general. State-of-the art spectroscopic analysis methods essential&nbsp;for these studies are currently being developed in the group of De Koter at the UvA.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. &nbsp;ALERT &ndash; the Apertif Legacy Exploration of the Radio Transient Sky</strong></p>\r\n<p>Supervisor:&nbsp;Joeri van Leeuwen (UvA/ASTRON)</p>\r\n<p>Co-supervisors:&nbsp;Jason Hessels (ASTRON/UvA), Michiel van der Klis (UvA), Ralph Wijers (UvA) &amp; Heino Falcke (Nijmegen)</p>\r\n<p>In our largely constant radio Universe, a highly dynamic component was&nbsp;recently discovered: flashes of bright radio emission that last only&nbsp;milliseconds but appear all over the sky. Some of these short-lived&nbsp;radio bursts can be traced to neutron stars, but the extremely limited&nbsp;activity has so far prevented determination of the origin and&nbsp;formation of this neutron-star population. &nbsp;Other bursts apparently&nbsp;originate far outside our Galaxy, and defy any explanation. &nbsp;Due to&nbsp;great observational challenges the nature of these extragalactic&nbsp;bursts remains a mystery. &nbsp;In ``ALERT'', we will carry out by far the&nbsp;deepest all-sky search for radio bursts ever undertaken. Exploiting&nbsp;the novel wide-field Apertif receivers on Westerbork, we will increase&nbsp;by a factor of 10 our exploration volume for fast transients&nbsp;throughout the Universe, and use these data to both map the population&nbsp;intermittently bursting neutron stars, and characterize and localize&nbsp;extragalactic bursts; to finally, and for the first time, understand&nbsp;the origin of both.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. &nbsp;How does Sgr A* relate to other black holes?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Supervisor: &nbsp;Sera Markoff (UvA)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Co-supervisors: &nbsp;Heino Falcke &amp; Elmar K&ouml;rding (Nijmegen); Elena Rossi &amp; Simon Portegies Zwart (Leiden)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The Galactic center is our closest galactic nucleus, harboring the weakest known accreting supermassive black hole, Sgr A*.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sgr A* has been the driver for many theoretical studies of radiatively inefficient accretion and jet launching, and we are now at a stage where years of semi-analytical models&nbsp;by the PI and others are converging with predictions from sophisticated MHD simulations (see eg. Dibi et al. 2012).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However many questions still exist, particularly about the existence of a fully collimated jet outflow, and the spin of the black hole.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sgr A* also exhibits roughly daily X-ray flares, often&nbsp;simultaneous with the IR, hinting at stochastic plasma processes including magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration events.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sgr A* is thus the ideal testbed for accretion inflow/outflow theory, plasma astrophysics, particle acceleration and general relativity, and an important source for&nbsp;quantifying AGN activity in &ldquo;normal&rdquo; galaxies. &nbsp; NOVA-4 falls at an extremely opportune time, between an unprecedented multiwavelength campaign in 2012 centered around a 3Msec Chandra X-ray Visionary Project, and an infalling gas cloud predicted to encounter Sgr A* in mid 2013. &nbsp;&nbsp;In this project we will focus on semi-analytical models (guided by MHD simulations performed within the cluster, via CoI K&ouml;rding), to develop new models that account for time-dependent particle evolution as well as MHD-consistent jet models that link inflow to outflow for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will build on&nbsp;groundwork from recent papers deriving new MHD flow solutions (Polko, Meier &amp; Markoff 2010, 2012a,b) that allow an unambiguous connection between the jet dynamics and particle acceleration.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fermi Bubbles and X-ray light echos in the Galactic center further hint at Sgr A* having been&nbsp;significantly more active in the past, and based on its renewed activity, we will also make predictions for the emission of Sgr A* during the past, and test it against the current limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;The project will be carried out by a PhD student based at UvA, with close ties to RU and UL within the GC cluster.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;student will have proprietary access to a large array of new data from the XVP and associated multiwavelength campaigns. &nbsp; Though the project is focused primarily on Sgr A*,&nbsp;much of the work will also apply to other nearby AGN such as M81, M87, M31, M33 etc, and related studies can be expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will use the new campaign data to place Sgr A* firmly into context with&nbsp;other low luminosity AGN. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>7. &nbsp;Revealing the clockwork: the physical origin of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in black holes and neutron stars</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Supervisor: Phil Uttley (UvA)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Co-Supervisors: Michiel van der Klis (UvA), Mariano Mendez (Kapteyn Institute, Groningen)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the X-ray light curves of black holes and neutron stars are clocks that probe the conditions in extreme gravity close to the compact object. The origin of the QPOs is not yet settled, but could relate to instabilities in the mass-accretion flow, or alternatively, to the precession of the flow in the strongly-curved space-time close to the compact object.&nbsp; If this puzzle can be solved, we will unveil a wealth of new information about the most extreme objects in the universe.&nbsp; Now, using newly-developed spectral-timing techniques, X-ray observations of black holes and neutron stars allow us to &lsquo;map&rsquo; the structure and motion of matter as it accretes on to the compact object, by measuring time-lags between variations in the emission from the different components of the accretion flow, as they respond to fluctuations in the mass accretion rate and/or changes in the geometry of the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neutron stars also generate emission as matter hits the solid surface, so that we should see clear differences in the time-lag behaviour between neutron stars and black holes.&nbsp; This project will combine measurements of the time-lags from X-ray observations of neutron star and black hole X-ray binaries with models for the QPO, to try to finally reveal the origin of these enigmatic signals.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>8. &nbsp;Supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae observations with LOFAR</strong></p>\r\n<p>Supervisor: Jacco Vink (UvA)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Co-Supervisors: Marijke Haverkorn (Nijmegen), Jason Hessels (ASTRON/UvA), Joeri van Leeuwen (ASTRON/UvA)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The estimated number of SNRs in the Galaxy is 1500-3000, whereas the detected number of SNRs is less than 300. LOFAR provides the ideal telescope to search&nbsp;for the missing SNRs in the northern part of the sky: radio observations give a relatively unobscured view of the total galaxy, and the low frequency coverage of&nbsp;LOFAR is ideal for SNRs, as the SNRs population starts to dominate over HII regions, due to the steepness of SNR spectra. Finally, LOFAR will reveal a whole new aspect of SNRs and related sources such as pulsar wind nebulae, because the low frequency radio domain has only poorly been explored. This low frequency domain&nbsp;is connected to the acceleration of low energy cosmic rays, which are an pressure component and source of ionization in the Galaxy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>9. &nbsp;Radio bursts from magnetars</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Supervisor: Anna Watts (UvA)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Co-Supervisors: Jason Hessels (ASTRON/UvA), Joeri van Leeuwen (ASTRON/UVA), Alexander van der Horst (UvA)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Highly magnetic neutron stars, known as magnetars, emit regular bursts of gamma-ray emission that are thought to be associated with magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration.&nbsp; The process is similar to that involved in solar flares, although heavily modified by processes unique to such strong magnetic fields.&nbsp; This has led to speculation that magnetar bursts, like solar flares, might be accompanied by radio bursts, which would provide new insight into the trigger process and burst energetics.&nbsp; This project will study prospects for radio emission from magnetar bursts, to determine whether this offers a means of distinguishing competing physical models for burst trigger and emission processes.&nbsp; This theoretical study will support and provide the means to interpret a simultaneous multi-wavelength magnetar burst monitoring campaign using the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the LOFAR and Westerbork radio telescopes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>10. &nbsp;Black-hole ejecta physics: Spectro-temporal modeling of tidal disruption events</strong></p>\r\n<p>Supervisor: Ralph Wijers (UvA)</p>\r\n<p>Co-supervisors: Sera Markoff (UvA), Elmar Koerding (Nijmegen), Heino Falcke (Nijmegen)</p>\r\n<p>Transient jets address basic physics problems both in their generation (engines), their outward transport (jets) and their eventual dissipation (AGN lobes, GRB blast waves). We will combine AGN and GRB modeling expertise to make the full connection between all three, and use tidal disruption events to test the resulting models, since these are one of the few where one can observe all phenomena from engine to jet dissipation.</p>\r\n<p>The student will learn the principles of disk/jet physics and jet/GRB dissipation. She will then develop a framework in which a joint model of the generation of a jet and its final dissipation is constructed, with a well-defined set of free parameters (e.g., temporal profile of accreted matter, black-hole mass, ambient density, jet efficiency, etc.) and model a complete event from the tidal disruption to the final dissipation of energy. Some phases can already be connected ab initio, in some other phases we will make use of empirically derived correlations, such as the BH accretion fundamental plane, if need be. The outcome will be models of the SED of the event as a function of time, depending on a set of parameters, and fits of those modes to a few good data sets. Whether such fits are possible, and yield plausible parameters, will test our understanding of the physics.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>11. &nbsp;AGN Feedback and SMBH Growth with LOFAR</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Supervisor: Michael Wise (ASTRON/UvA)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Co-Supervisors: George Heald (ASTRON/Groningen), Jacco Vink (UvA), Phil Uttley (UvA)</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">We propose to use exciting new data from LOFAR&rsquo;s first all-sky survey to study such open questions as how black holes grow over cosmic time, how feedback from black holes moderates the growth of galaxies, and how the combined effects of black hole feedback and mergers determine the growth of the large-scale structure that we observe. As the largest gravitationally bound objects, clusters retain an archeological record of the integrated effects of these physical processes over a significant fraction of the age of the Universe. The hot atmospheres of clusters serve as a repository for the exhaust generated by the growth of supermassive black holes (SMHBs) in the forms of excess entropy, relativistic particles, and magnetic fields. Radio sources trace the enormous amount of mechanical energy deposited into the ICM by SMBHs and may be the principal agent dispersing chemical elements created by stellar evolution throughout the intercluster and intergalactic medium. SMBHs are now believed to play a central role in galaxy formation through a feedback process that regulates both star formation in the host galaxy and the rate of accretion onto the black hole. Low frequency radio observations represent a unique and powerful new tool to probe this archeological record in galaxy clusters. We will use the results of new and ongoing all-sky surveys with LOFAR to study these effects in the largest sample of clusters ever obtained at low radio frequencies. The process of amassing this new data is well underway as LOFAR has already begun its first all-sky, pathfinder survey (MSSS) earlier this year and a large fraction of the survey data is already available to be explored. Now is the ideal time for such a study as LOFAR will provide the largest and most sensitive catalog of radio observations on clusters ever obtained in this frequency range and down to frequencies that have never been probed before. The project will be done in collaboration with staff members at ASTRON, the University of Amsterdam, and Leiden University as well as researchers in France, Germany, and the United States.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "text": "<p><img src=\"/media/uploads/jobs/berg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"89\" /></p>\r\n<p>The Netherlands Research School for Astronomy (NOVA), as part of its research program <em>Formation and evolution of stars and planetary systems</em>, plans to  start a PhD project at the University of Amsterdam focused on the  formation and early evolution of the most massive stars.</p>\r\n<p>The mechanism by which the  massive stars (M &gt; 8 Msun) form is poorly understood. Even though  they are the most luminous objects in the Galaxy, their formation  process and early evolution  are obscured from view due to the tens to hundreds of magnitudes of  (visual) extinction. The recent  development of sensitive spectroscopic techniques at near-infrared  wavelengths allows for the first time direct detections  and quantitative analysis of the characteristics of massive  proto-stars. These objects are surrounded by a disk and, in case the  photospheric spectrum can be detected, turn out to be &ldquo;bloated&rdquo; stars,  i.e. are apparently still contracting towards the main sequence.  These so-called massive Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) must represent a  later phase of formation than the luminous extended disk sources that  can be detected at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths, though it is unclear at  the moment how these two phases are precisely  related. In this project we will study the physical link between these  two, likely subsequent phases of massive star formation by combining  ALMA and near-IR imaging and spectroscopy of star-forming regions in the  Milky Way and Local Group galaxies, in particular  the Magellanic Clouds.</p>\r\n<p>Such a multi-wavelength approach will allow us to study massive star formation in an environmental context, including aspects of metallicity and cluster  mass/density. By establishing the physical properties of the newly  formed stars &ndash; such  as photospheric parameters, binary properties, rotational  characteristics, ionizing fluxes, and radiation-driven winds &ndash; we will  assess the importance of feedback from this new population on the star  formation process in general. &nbsp;State-of-the art spectroscopic  analysis methods essential for these studies are currently being  developed in the group of prof. De Koter at the UvA.</p>\r\n<p>Our strategy will be to extend the covered wavelength  range of the many candidate young massive stars, thereby directly  probing the stellar photosphere and wind.  Optical/nIR spectra have been (and will be) obtained with X-shooter on  the ESO Very Large Telescope in Chile. One of the goals of the project  is to relate the found results to observations obtained at longer  wavelengths (e.g. ALMA). Reduction, analysis, and  interpretation of the obtained data, including the collection of new  data, will form a major part of the project that should lead to a PhD at  the University of Amsterdam. The position is offered for a period of 4  years and should be taken up in the Fall of  2013. The salary will be on the standard Dutch university scale.</p>\r\n<p>Interested candidates should have a Master degree in  astronomy or physics (or the equivalent). Applications should contain a  curriculum vitae, a statement of research  experience and motivation, and the names of two references, to be sent  to:</p>\r\n<p>Prof.dr. L. Kaper, Sterrenkundig Instituut Anton Pannekoek, Universiteit van Amsterdam, Postbus 94249, 1090 GE Amsterdam.</p>\r\n<p>Review of the applications will start on July 1, 2013, and continue until the position is filled.</p>",

      "text": "<p>The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) has just launched a new research initiative in Astroparticle Physics, with a particular focus on understanding relativistic compact objects using a combined theoretical and multi-messenger approach. &nbsp;Four interconnected projects will be conducted within different national research groups as detailed below, with topics reflecting Dutch Astronomy and Particle Physics expertise in the areas of cosmic rays, gamma-rays and gravitational waves. &nbsp;The projects will be coordinated within the national Astroparticle Physics framework, and successful candidates will have significant interactions with their counterparts at other universities, and the Dutch Astroparticle Physics community, via frequent collaboration and yearly national meetings.</p>\r\n<p>As part of this program, two postdoctoral research positions (up to 3 yrs, conditional on performance) are available at the University of Amsterdam, within the API/GRAPPA institutes:</p>\r\n<p>1) Experimental TeV Gamma-ray Astronomy: The successful candidate will be an excellent experimentalist ready to lead the construction of two cameras for the small-size telescopes (SSTs) of CTA (http://www.cta-observatory.org). These two cameras will be mounted on two dual-mirror optics SSTs, produced within a UK-French-Japanese-German-Dutch sub-consortium of CTA. &nbsp;Applicants should have an interest in instrumentation, and the ambition to lead the Dutch camera effort, and ideally have experience with fast electronics in particle physics or astroparticle physics experiments. Contributions to the first very-high-energy gamma-ray data analyses of the CTA-SST prototypes are expected at 20% of the candidate's time. &nbsp;There is ample opportunity to participate in directing PhD and MSc student projects. &nbsp; Supervisor: D. Berge (Amsterdam), Collaborators: A. van den Berg (KVI/Groningen), J. H&ouml;randel (RU Nijmegen), S. Markoff (Amsterdam), O. Scholten (KVI/Groningen), L. Venema (ASTRON &amp; U Leiden), J. Vink (Amsterdam). &nbsp;The position will involve frequent travel to, and extensive collaboration with, the Universities of Groningen and Nijmegen. Contact: &nbsp;d.berge@uva.nl</p>\r\n<p>2) Theoretical: &nbsp;The successful candidate will use a mix of semi-analytical methods and Particle-in-Cell techniques to study the conditions for turbulence, plasma instabilities and shock acceleration specifically for Galactic XRBs, with the goal of producing more self-consistent models to predict cosmic ray and TeV gamma-ray fluxes. &nbsp;Interest and some experience in coding and theoretical astrophysics are required, experience in semi-analytical and/or numerical MHD/astrophysics or PIC codes a definite plus. &nbsp;Position is based in Amsterdam, but travel to visit collaborators is encouraged. &nbsp;Supervisors: S. Markoff (Amsterdam) and B. Achterberg (RU Nijmegen). &nbsp;Collaborators: A. Boyarsky (Leiden), D. Berge (Amsterdam), D. Caprioli (Princeton), M. Dieckmann (Linkoeping), A. Marcowith (Montpellier), J. Vink (Amsterdam). &nbsp;Contact: &nbsp;s.b.markoff@uva.nl</p>\r\n<div>Interested applicants should send a CV, list of publications and a brief (1 page) statement of relevant research experience and interests, plus the names and email addresses of three references, directly to the contact person listed above. &nbsp;Complete applications received by 1 November 2014 will be given priority, though applications will be considered until positions are filled. &nbsp;Candidates must have their PhDs by the start date and within the last three years (minus parental leave etc.). &nbsp;The appointments will ideally begin by March 2015, but a starting date no later than September 2015 may be negotiated. &nbsp;Females and minorities are especially encouraged to apply.</div>\r\n<p>The Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy (API) is a lively research institutes with about a dozen each of faculty and postdocs, and ~25 each of PhD and Masters students (see http://www.astro.uva.nl). &nbsp; Gravitation and Astroparticle Physics Amsterdam (GRAPPA) is a new Astroparticle Physics initiative involving API, as well as the Institute for Theoretical Physics Amsterdam (ITFA) and Institute for High Energy Physics (IHEF) at the University of Amsterdam, with seven full time faculty and many associated faculty, postdocs and students (see&nbsp;http://grappa.science.uva.nl). &nbsp; About half of our researchers are foreign and English is the lingua franca in the Science Faculy of the University of Amsterdam. &nbsp; &nbsp;The Science Faculty of the University of Amsterdam is located about a 20 minute bicycle ride or an 8 minute direct train ride from the downtown main train station, &nbsp;at the Amsterdam Science Park, also the informatics/computing technology center of the Netherlands. &nbsp; Amsterdam was recently ranked the 2nd most 'liveable' city in the world by the EIU.</p>",
