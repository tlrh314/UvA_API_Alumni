                        The Anton Pannekoek Institute has developed a new website for our alumni. This website shows our alumni with contactinfo, the theses published by (former) API's, interviews with some of our alumni, and some (anonymised) statistics. <br>
                        <br>            
                        The first step in this survey is to (re)set the password for the account we have made for you. At a later point in time you can then revisit our website and update your information. The second step is to verify and update the information we already have in our database, followed by a few questions on the nature of your current employment. In the penultimate (optional) step we would like to ask you to provide insight into the first, second and third job that you landed after leaving the API. The final step is to verify that you are satisfied with your personal alumnus page. <br>
                        <br>
                        At the end of the survey you are automatically directed to your personal API Alumnus page! Note that the information on your page is visible for all to see. Therefore we include privacy settings in the survey that are taken into account for which information is shown to the world. For example, you can choose to show or hide your e-mail address. Hiding means that your e-mail address will only be available to the API secretariat such that we know how to get in contact with you in the years to come, but it will not be included on your personal page. We would like to ask you to provide us with an e-mail address that you expect will remain active regardless of a change in position. <br>
                        <br>
                        Examples of the anonymised statistics could be the number of API alumni that stayed in academia, or the percentage of API's that now works at a bank.  <br>
                        <br>
                        Thanks for taking the time to fill out our survey!
