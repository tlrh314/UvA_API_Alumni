You can put things like FAQs here, or have a progress page on the latests happenings regarding e.g. an upcoming or current event. \r\n\r\nThese wiki pages are editable only by API people, but accessible, and thus readable, by all API people. Information about, for example, a research group, that is sensitive shouldn't be on this wiki.\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\nYou can find the list of all pages [here](/internal/wiki/all/)  \r\nStudents or employees that are new to the institute and/or linux might want to start with the [tips for newcomers](for_newcomers).\r\n\r\n## Creating a new page\r\n\r\nUse the [\"create a new page\"](/internal/wiki/create/) link on the left. A page name can consist of numbers and letters, underscores and dashes; the difference between upper- and lowercase is ignored. There is no explicit wiki naming necessity or convention like CapitalizedWords.\r\n\r\nYou can create or use existing *category* pages to groups things and keep a set of pages together.\r\n\r\n## Edit a page\r\n\r\nClick on the blue \"Edit page\" link to edit a page. The editing box appears below the preview box on the actual editing page; the preview gets updated once you've pressed \"Save\".\r\n\r\nThis wiki uses markdown with a few extensions (for eg tables) for layout. See the [\"help on editing\"](help-editing-wikipage) page for more information.\r\n\r\n## Page history\r\n\r\nThere is *no* page history or undo function. If you remove text and then save the edited page, or delete a page, you cannot undo that. You can always make a copy of the old text in a simple text file, to be on the safe side.\r\n",

      "text": "# How to edit a wikipage\r\n\r\nThis wiki uses markdown to mark-up the layout of the wiki pages. There is a [full description](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) of the markdown syntax, but below are examples of the nost common uses.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the actual markdown specificiation, HTML tags cannot be used on this wiki. Also, a few extra options are available, for creating [definition lists](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Definition_Lists), [footnotes](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Footnotes) or [simple tables](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Tables).\r\n\r\nUse the source of this page for an idea how to use the markup syntax.\r\n\r\n## Basic markdown\r\n\r\nUse \\**single*\\* or \\*\\***double**\\*\\* asterisks for emphasis. Special characters like an \\*, \\_ or a \\\\ can be escaped by prepending it with a \\\\.\r\n\r\nParagraphs are automatically created when text is separated by an empty line. Paragraphs are preferred over line breaks, which can be forced by adding two spaces at the end of the line.\r\n\r\nFor (sub)section titles , use \\# in front of the section title: \r\n\r\n    # section level 1 (page title)  \r\n    ## section level 2  \r\n    ### section level 3\r\n\r\netc, results in:\r\n\r\n# section level 1 (page title)  \r\n## section level 2  \r\n### section level 3\r\n\r\nNote that the section levels layout follows the default layout of the API webpages.\r\nYou can also underline titles with dashes or equal signs.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * Lists are easily made\r\n    * Do not put blank lines between list items\r\n    * You can also use a \\+ or \\- sign,  \r\n      and have text across multiple lines\r\n\r\nwhich results in:\r\n\r\n* Lists are easily made\r\n* Do not put blank lines between list items\r\n* You can also use a \\+ or \\- sign,  \r\n  and have text across multiple lines\r\n\r\n> You can create quotes using \\>; the quotes  \r\n> can of course span more lines\r\n\r\nText indented by four spaces (or tab) forms a code block.\r\n\r\nThree or more dashes in a paragraph on their own form a horizontal line.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\nA simple link can be created \\[as this\\]\\(wiki\\), which would be a relative link to a page called \"wiki\", but with the text \"as this\". This would be a link on the wiki site itself; for outside links, use the full URL (including the http).\r\n\r\nFor some links, you may prefer to separate them from the main text, using a *label*, \\[as in this example\\]\\[some label\\]. The label is then later used to specify the actual link, as below. And this can even be \\[shorter\\]\\[\\] using an empty label.\r\n\r\n\\[some label\\]: http://www.astro.uva.nl/internal/\r\n\r\n\\[shorter\\]: http://www.astro.uva.nl/institute/\r\n\r\n## Images\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you can't upload images to this wiki, but you can put them elsewhere and then link from here. The syntax is similar to the one for URLs, but starting with an \\!\\[exclamation mark\\]\\(http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1149/1070601182_0fe532a667.jpg\\)]![exclamation mark](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1149/1070601182_0fe532a667_s.jpg). You can use the label technique as for URLs.\r\n\r\n## Tables\r\n\r\nYou can only create very simple tables, but for the purposes of this wiki, that is hopefully sufficient. An example table:\r\n\r\n    First Header  | Second Header\r\n    ------------- | -------------\r\n    Content Cell  | Content Cell\r\n    Content Cell  | Content Cell\r\n\r\nlooks like\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Header  | Second Header\r\n------------- | -------------\r\nContent Cell  | Content Cell\r\nContent Cell  | Content Cell\r\n",

      "text": "# Remote access\r\n\r\n### How do I log in to another computer in the network?\r\n\r\nTo access another computer in the institute, use:\r\n\r\n    > ssh computername\r\n\r\nwhere computername is the name (f.e. `astro001`) or number (f.e. `u013469`) of the computer. (If you want to use more than just the terminal, add ' -Y' to enable X11 forwarding. If you login from another account, use `ssh username@computername`)\r\n\r\n### How do I get to files on another computer at the institute? \r\n\r\nThe `scratch` (and sometimes `scratch1`) partitions of most of the institute's machines can be approached via the `/net` directory; for instance, `/net/astro001/scratch1` is the `/scratch1` partition belonging to `astro001` (students' machine). \r\n\r\n\r\n### How do I access my files from a linux computer outside the university?\r\n\r\nYou can log in via ssh, and/or download files via scp. You cannot access computers at the institute directly, you have to login to the mremote server first:\r\n\r\n    > ssh username@mremote.science.uva.nl\r\n\r\n(If you want to use more than just the terminal, add ' -Y' to enable X11 forwarding)\r\nFrom there you can access your home directory and scratch drives mounted in /net , or you can login to another machine in the network using ssh.\r\n\r\n* *If X11 forwarding doesn't work:*\r\n\r\nIf you have trouble opening new windows from the terminal, check that X11 forwarding is allowed.   First, edit the sshd_config file (located in /etc/ or /etc/ssh) to include the following uncommented line,\r\n\r\n    > X11Forwarding yes\r\n\r\nYou will need root access to edit sshd_config.  You will then need to set up an ssh tunnel from your local machine (i.e., the laptop you are using), through mremote into the desktop you are trying to access on the API network.  In this example, the desktop you are accessing has a name like 'u######', and the tunnel is opened through port 4022.\r\n\r\n     > ssh -Y -L 4022:u######.science.uva.nl:22  username@remote.science.uva.nl\r\n\r\nNow, you can ssh into your desktop by opening a new terminal and typing:\r\n\r\n     > ssh -Y -p4022 username@localhost\r\n\r\nThe -p command tells ssh to use port 4022 that you just opened.  Now you should be able to open new windows from the terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n* *To download files from your home account, use*\r\n\r\n    > scp username@mremote.science.uva.nl:filename .\r\n\r\n* *If you want to copy files from your scratch area, use something like*\r\n\r\n    > scp -r username@mremote.science.uva.nl:/net/astro001/scratch/username/subdir/file(s) .\r\n\r\nYou can also use programs that use sftp or ssh for file transfer, but ftp wil not work.\r\n\r\n### How to copy files to a local API machine, if that machine is not visible from mremote\r\n\r\n(Whereby \"not visible\" means you can't browse to it using /net/.)\r\n\r\nThis can happen for certain machines, or when the /net/ links aren't working for some reason.\r\n\r\nOne solution is to use an ssh tunnel, with mremote.science.uva.nl as intermediate; very similar to the above section. An example for my account on localhost:\r\n\r\n    ssh -L 2222:u028606.1x.uva.nl:22 martin@mremote.science.uva.nl\r\n\r\nIf ssh asks for your password, this will be your password on mremote.science.uva.nl.\r\nNow port 2222 on the localhost is tied to port 22 (ssh/scp) on u028606, through mremote.science.uva.nl.\r\n\r\nThen, in another terminal on the localhost (this should be the machine that has the data), you can use:\r\n\r\n    scp -P 2222 datafile[s] martin@localhost:.\r\n\r\nmeaning that scp uses port 2222 and copies files to localhost. Since port 2222 is tunneled to port 22 on u028606 however, these files are copied over to u028606. If scp asks for your password, this will be your password on u028606.1x.uva.nl.\r\n\r\nOf course, \"martin\" should be your appropriate science account, \"u028606\" the machine you want to copy stuff to and 2222 can be any port between 1024 and 65536 if wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How do I access my files from a windows computer outside the university?\r\n\r\nYou will need a terminal program like [putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) to login to mremote.science.uva.nl. If you want to use X11 forwarding, wou will need an X server such as [Xming](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/), [Cygwin+X11](http://x.cygwin.com/) or [vncserver](http://www.tightvnc.com/).\r\n\r\nFor those who are using vncviewer and putty at home, we'll explain how to setup this ssh tunneling. Here we go:\r\n\r\nYou start the vncserver on your computer at the api (say mira).  \r\nThe default port will be 5901\r\n\r\nThen in putty (category) at Session you fill in at Host Name:  \r\nmremote.science.uva.nl port 22\r\n\r\nGo to (category) SSH --> Tunnels  \r\nType in source port: 5901  \r\nType in destination: mira.science.uva.nl:5901   \r\nClick on Add\r\n\r\nThen go to (category)  Session,  \r\nclick on Default Settings and click on Save.  \r\nThis is for next time you start putty.\r\n\r\nClick \"Open\" at the bottom of putty.  \r\nYou will get a xterm to log in to remote.  \r\nJust do that.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now the Magic!  \r\nClick on vncviewer.  \r\nFill in at VNC server: 127.0.0.1:1  \r\nClick on connect and there it comes!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

First, edit the sshd_config file (located in /etc/ or /etc/ssh) to include the following uncommented line,</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; X11Forwarding yes\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will need root access to edit sshd_config.  You will then need to set up an ssh tunnel from your local machine (i.e., the laptop you are using), through mremote into the desktop you are trying to access on the API network.  In this example, the desktop you are accessing has a name like 'u######', and the tunnel is opened through port 4022.</p>\n<pre><code> &gt; ssh -Y -L 4022:u######.science.uva.nl:22  username@remote.science.uva.nl\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, you can ssh into your desktop by opening a new terminal and typing:</p>\n<pre><code> &gt; ssh -Y -p4022 username@localhost\n</code></pre>\n<p>The -p command tells ssh to use port 4022 that you just opened.  Now you should be able to open new windows from the terminal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>To download files from your home account, use</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>scp username@mremote.science.uva.nl:filename .</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>If you want to copy files from your scratch area, use something like</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>scp -r username@mremote.science.uva.nl:/net/astro001/scratch/username/subdir/file(s) .</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also use programs that use sftp or ssh for file transfer, but ftp wil not work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how_to_copy_files_to_a_local_api_machine_if_that_machine_is_not_visible_from_mremote\">How to copy files to a local API machine, if that machine is not visible from mremote</h3>\n<p>(Whereby \"not visible\" means you can't browse to it using /net/.)</p>\n<p>This can happen for certain machines, or when the /net/ links aren't working for some reason.</p>\n<p>One solution is to use an ssh tunnel, with mremote.science.uva.nl as intermediate; very similar to the above section.

This how-to lists most of them, so you have no excuse to hide in your office all day.\r\n\r\n## Daily\r\n\r\n**11:00ish Coffee break**\r\n:    Gather at the coffee table and talk about whatever you want with whomever you want. Free coffee and tea and occasionally biscuits, cake, sweets, pies...\r\n\r\n**13:00ish Lunch**\r\n:    Round up your officemates, go to the canteen on the ground floor, buy your lunch (or bring your own) and find a nice table to join.\r\n\r\n## Weekly\r\n\r\nThe [API agenda](/internal/agenda) has an up-to-date schedule of events, including speaker names and abstracts for the colloquia and pizza lunches.\r\n\r\n**Tuesday 16:00 Journal Club**\r\n:    APIs get together in the Pannekoek room to discuss recent papers. Sometimes there is tea to share, other times sweets are brought. Email Daniela to get on the list for reminder emails.\r\n\r\n**Wednesday 10:30 Info coffee**\r\n:    At infocoffee Ralph Wijers will update us all on new employees, guests and topical changes in our institute.\r\n\r\n**Wednesday 15:30 Colloquium**\r\n:    Most Wednesdays there is a colloquium by a staff member of another institute. This is considered part of the programme for students. Afterwards there is a little borrel with wine and cheese and juice in the API common room.\r\n\r\n**Thursday 12:00 Pizza lunch**\r\n:    Two people from the institute will give a talk, one a few minutes, the other around half an hour, on either their own research or on a topic of their interest in the colloquium room. Afterwards there is room for discussion.\r\n\r\n**Friday 17:00ish Whisky break**\r\n:    This is possibly the best way to get to know your fellow APIs. Almost every week, in the common room, the advertised drink is served, and the company enjoyed. Occasionally, GRAPPA crashes/joins us for whisky break.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Occasional\r\n\r\n**Group meetings**\r\n:    Research groups or interest groups of varying specificity have regular (or semi-regular) meetings, such as high energy astro, low energy astro, and X-ray timing. Ask your supervisor or someone in a similar field which meetings they attend, and who to contact to get on the email list. [GRAPPA](http://grappa.science.uva.nl/) also has a mailing list if you're interested in astro-particle physics and cosmology -- email their secretariat to get on the list. It's also a good idea to get on your relevant [NOVA research network](http://www.nova-astronomy.nl/Research.php) mailing list.\r\n\r\n**Beta Break**\r\n:    [Beta Break](http://www.betabreak.nl/) (website in Dutch) is a monthly event during the main academic year where a few academics from different fields have a discussion about the advertised topic. This takes place between the coffee bar and the elevators on the ground floor of the building. Recently the events have been in English.\r\n\r\n**Afternoon tea break**\r\n:    Very informal break, enjoyed by a few people. If you want to enter this select company, talk to Martin. It doesn't happen very frequently, but it is another time to offer cake if someone else has beaten you to the morning coffee break. There are also some tea aficionados (e.g., Abbie, Daniela, Lucy, etc.) who have a daily tea break either just after lunch or sometime in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n**Evening drinks**\r\n:    To celebrate the end of another successful week (sometimes just the end of a day), on most Fridays a group of people leave the institute to indulge in drink and happiness. The location changes, but it usually takes place in \"De Polder\" or \"Oerknal\" next door, \"Brouwerij 't IJ\" (known as The Windmill) or \"The East of Eden\".\r\n\r\n**Nerd Nite**\r\n:    Some APIs have been known to present at or attend [Amsterdam Nerd Nite](http://amsterdam.nerdnite.com/). All Nerd Nite events are held in English. Check the website for when the next one is and ask around to see who else is going. Posters for the upcoming Nerd Nite are usually posted in the coffee area.\r\n\r\n**Birthdays**\r\n:    On an API's birthday, it is their responsibility to bring in cake (or other sweets) to share with the institute at morning coffee break. They will send out an email to the institute alerting everyone that today is their birthday and they brought cake.\r\n\r\n## Branching out\r\n\r\n**Dutch courses**\r\n:    The UvA offers a variety of [Dutch courses](http://intt.uva.nl/dutch-for-foreigners/nav) for foreigners at different levels and intensities. Abbie, C\u00e1tia, Riley, and Phil (among others) have taken some of these courses, so you can ask them questions if you're considering taking one.\r\n\r\n**Meetups**\r\n:    A nice way to meet people in Amsterdam with similar interests is through [meetups](http://amsterdam.meetup.com/). Sign up for groups and events that sound interesting!\r\n\r\n**Universum Sports Centre**\r\n:    Sports and exercise classes at [Universum](http://www.usc.uva.nl/algemeen/index_en.php), right next door in Science Park, are also a nice way to have fun and make friends! All exercise classes are conducted in Dutch, but nearly all the instructors speak English and are happy to accommodate non-Dutch-speakers.\r\n\r\n**English-language events**\r\n:    [i amsterdam](http://www.iamsterdam.com/en-GB/living/Expatcenter/expatcenter-partners) has a list of media and events partners that specifically cater to the English-speaking expat community (scroll down to 'Media & events' at the link). Most of these have a newsletter or forum to stay up-to-date.\r\n\r\n**The American Book Center**\r\n:    The [American Book Center](http://www.abc.nl/), in the city center, is one of a few bookstores in Amsterdam that sell English-language books and magazines. They also have a social calendar (with events like American Thanksgiving) and a bi-annual book sale that is not to be missed. \r\n\r\n\r\nOf course this is only the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Check the [API agenda](/internal/agenda), or become a member of the [API Google calendar](mac_os_x-ical-api_calendar) for more events, or add your own.",

You can add it to your aliases to replace ls or create a new command (lc, for example).\r\n\r\n## Customization\r\n\r\n### The easy way\r\n\r\nYou can customize the colours used in one of two ways. First, you can change how your terminal interprets the colours it's asked to draw: \"blue\" (for example) obviously covers a multitude of hues, and most terminal emulators will let you tweak exactly which one they use. You'll have to refer to your terminal emulator's documentation for help with this, though.\r\n\r\n### The hard way\r\n\r\nSecondly, you can set the environment variable `$LS_COLORS`. Unfortunately, configuring this properly can be rather awkward, but you can use the `dircolors` command for help. Refer to its man page for full details (ie, type `man dircolors`). Run it with the `-p` option to print an example configuration file which you can tweak to your liking. Save the result to a file (`~/.dircolors` is traditional), as shown:\r\n\r\n    $ dircolors -p > ~/.dircolors\r\n\r\nOpen it in your favourite text editor and scroll to below all the TERM nonsense.

Other versions might differ slightly.\r\n\r\nEmacs version 21 automatically indented Python code out of the box. In version 22 some work has to be done to get the same behaviour. The following website was used for this HowTo: [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PythonMode](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PythonMode).\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick note [*added by Evert, Nov 2011*]: emacs 22 should have its own python mode installed by default, but not the traditional python-mode.el (instead, it's called [python.el](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ProgrammingWithPythonDotEl): this version should deal better with triple quotes syntax highlighting, for example; the only possible caveat is that <return> not automatically indents as well; <ctrl-j> does that now. There is [a solution](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ProgrammingWithPythonDotEl#toc1) for that, of course. (warning: python-mode.el may still be referred to in your .emacs.d/init.el and clobber things.)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Download Emacs mode\r\n\r\n* Create the folder elisp in your home directory.\r\n* Download python-mode.el from [https://launchpad.net/python-mode](https://launchpad.net/python-mode) to that folder. [Direct link to version 5.1.0](http://launchpad.net/python-mode/trunk/5.1.0/+download/python-mode.el)\r\n\r\n## In your .emacs file:\r\n\r\n* Open your .emacs file in a text editor\r\n* Copy the folowing code to your .emacs file\r\n\r\n        (if (fboundp 'normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path)\r\n            (let* ((my-lisp-dir \"~/elisp/\")\r\n                  (default-directory my-lisp-dir))\r\n               (setq load-path (cons my-lisp-dir load-path))\r\n               (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path)))\r\n\r\n* Also copy the following snippet:\r\n\r\n        (autoload 'python-mode \"python-mode\" \"Python Mode.\" t)\r\n        (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.py\\\\'\" . python-mode))\r\n        (add-to-list 'interpreter-mode-alist '(\"python\" . python-mode))\r\n\r\n* Save the .emacs file and reload Emacs.

The following website was used for this HowTo: <a href=\"http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PythonMode\">http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PythonMode</a>.</p>\n<p>Quick note [<em>added by Evert, Nov 2011</em>]: emacs 22 should have its own python mode installed by default, but not the traditional python-mode.el (instead, it's called <a href=\"http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ProgrammingWithPythonDotEl\">python.el</a>: this version should deal better with triple quotes syntax highlighting, for example; the only possible caveat is that &lt;return&gt; not automatically indents as well; &lt;ctrl-j&gt; does that now. There is <a href=\"http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ProgrammingWithPythonDotEl#toc1\">a solution</a> for that, of course. (warning: python-mode.el may still be referred to in your .emacs.d/init.el and clobber things.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"download_emacs_mode\">Download Emacs mode</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Create the folder elisp in your home directory.</li>\n<li>Download python-mode.el from <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/python-mode\">https://launchpad.net/python-mode</a> to that folder. <a href=\"http://launchpad.net/python-mode/trunk/5.1.0/+download/python-mode.el\">Direct link to version 5.1.0</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"in_your_emacs_file\">In your .emacs file:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Open your .emacs file in a text editor</li>\n<li>\n<p>Copy the folowing code to your .emacs file</p>\n<pre><code>(if (fboundp 'normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path)\n    (let* ((my-lisp-dir \"~/elisp/\")\n          (default-directory my-lisp-dir))\n       (setq load-path (cons my-lisp-dir load-path))\n       (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path)))\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Also copy the following snippet:</p>\n<pre><code>(autoload 'python-mode \"python-mode\" \"Python Mode.\" t)\n(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.py\\\\'\" . python-mode))\n(add-to-list 'interpreter-mode-alist '(\"python\" . python-mode))\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Save the .emacs file and reload Emacs.

It is used to analyse Swift and RXTE observations. The current version is 6.14 as of 30-Oct-2013, when this page was last updated. You want the source install. \r\n\r\n## Configuration for Linux\r\nThese Linux directions are from when HEASoft was in version 6.5.\r\n\r\nAdd the following lines to your .aliases file located in your home directory:\r\n\r\n    # Heasoft aliases\r\n    alias   start_xray      'source ${HEADAS}/headas-init.csh'\r\n\r\nBecause other programs sometimes use the same name for libraries that are not related, you are advised to type \"start_xray\" in a terminal where you will only use HEASoft programs and use different terminals for other programs.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know whether your machine is 32- or 64-bit, type \"uname -a\" in a terminal and if the returned line contains \"x86_64\" your machine is 64-bit.\r\n\r\nIf you have a 64-bit system add the following lines in your .pkgrc file located in your home directory:\r\n\r\n    caldb\r\n    xray64\r\n\r\nIf you have a 32-bit system add the following lines in your .pkgrc file located in your home directory:\r\n\r\n    caldb\r\n    xray\r\n\r\nThere might be issues with the 64-bit version. If you encounter a problem, contact the ICT-contact person.\r\n\r\n##Starting from Scratch on a Mac\r\nThe following is compiled by Abbie, after much trial and tribulation, for Mac OS X 10.8.5. If at any point something doesn't make sense, ask Abbie or someone else or google it, and we'll help you and update the wiki.\r\n\r\nNote that my personal preferences are for macports and bash, so that's what this is written for. If you prefer fink or homebrew, or the c-shell, modify these guidelines accordingly. I specify if you should install something with macports, and if I don't say 'use macports' then I did it manually.\r\n\r\n### Things you need to download/install and do, in order:\r\n:    1) Install XQuartz\r\n:    2) Install Xcode (need version 4.6.3, since 5 doesn't work for HEASoft)\r\n:    3) Get Xcode command line tools (Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads -> Install cmd line tools)\r\n:    4) Install Java dev. package (I don't remember if this is necessary, but I did it here and my HEASoft works, so why not)\r\n:    5) Install Macports\r\n:    6) Now add /opt/local/bin, /opt/local/sbin, and /usr/bin to your path variable in bashrc\r\n:    7) selfupdate macports\r\n:    8) Use macports to install: intltool, gawk, libtool, automake, mawk, pkgconfig\r\n:    9) Install libpng\r\n:    10) Use macports to install: libgc, GMP, MPFR, MPC, wget, g95, cairo, Lzip, pango, nawk, ncurses, gmake\r\n:    11) Install LittleCMS (again, I don't remember if this is necessary, but I did it at this point in the install process, or actually after g95 and before cairo, and my HEASoft works)\r\n:    12) Install gcc 4.7 + universal using macports\r\n:    13) Set paths for gcc, g++, and perl in bashrc using the /usr/bin paths (these ones were downloaded with Xcode & command line tools), and set gfortran using the /opt/local/bin path (this one was downloaded with gcc 4.7 with macports)\r\n:    14) Make a directory /usr/local/src: 'sudo mkdir /usr/local/src'\r\n:    15) Use macports to install readline\r\n:    16) Install S-Lang in /usr/local/src (download tarball, open it, move that folder into /usr/local/src, and then follow install instructions)\r\n:    17) Use the 'ln' command to link wget into the /usr/bin\r\n:    18) Use macports to install pgplot\r\n:    19) Install SLIRP, slxfig, and SLStats manually into /usr/local/src\r\n:    20) In a terminal window type 'sudo -E bash', so that you're a root user (check with 'whoami')\r\n:    21) Download the HEASoft tarball from the HEASARC website. Move the opened tarball folder to /usr/local/src, and open the install instructions and follow along. You're doing the source install.

Therefore, nice or renice your program, such that they only take up cpu power that is not used by the system or main user. If you normally launch a program via:  \r\n`command [arguments]`  \r\nyou can give it a lower priority by launching it with:  \r\n`nice +19 command [arguments]`  \r\nor  \r\n`nice -n 19 command [arguments]`  \r\ndepending on what kind of terminal you use. Renice-ing to 19 gives your process lowest priority, so you do not stall the computer even if you use 100% CPU.\r\n\r\nNote that nice only works for CPU, not memory! If you want to use all available memory, make sure no-one else uses the machine you want to use.\r\n\r\n## How can I log out but keep my processes running?\r\nYou have to run the proces in background running mode by adding an ampersand `&` after your command:  \r\n`command [arguments] &`  \r\nIf command produces any output, you have to redirect this to a file using `>&`, else the program crashes after logout.  \r\n`command [arguments] >& file &`  \r\n(note that a '>' alone also redirects the output, but not any error messages)\r\n\r\nYou can also send a program that is running in the foreground to the bakground. Use `bg` to do this.  \r\n`ctr-z`  \r\n`bg`  \r\nwill suspend the process you are running and put in in `background` running mode.  \r\n`fg`  \r\nwill get it to the foreground so you can interact with the process again.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to send active processes to the foreground or background by using their job ID. A job is a process which has been started from the current shell. To get a list of the running jobs, just type \r\n`jobs`  \r\nThe output will look somewhat like this:  \r\n`[1]     Running                       firefox`  \r\n`[2]     Suspended                     kile`  \r\n`[3]   + Running                       xmms`   \r\n`[4]   - Running                       nedit`  \r\n\t\r\nTo send nedit to the foreground, just type  \r\n`fg [4]`  \r\n\r\n## How can I log out but keep my processes running using the 'screen' command? \r\nThe `screen` command allows you to create a linux terminal which stays running in the background. It is possible to log the output in a file while the process is running. To start a new session of `screen` just type  \r\n`screen`  \r\nScreen will start up. You can now just do as if it were a normal terminal. When you want to start logging the in- and output, just press `ctrl-a H`. From now on, all output will be dumped in a file called `screenlog.0`. Then, you can simply `detach` the screen session by pressing `ctrl-a d`. Everything will continue running and logging, even when you log out and in again. To continue working from the screen you left, just type  \r\n`screen -r`  \r\nThis will `reattach` the screen and you will be able to continue issuing commands to it. If you have multiple screens running, this command will tell you that it does not know which one to reattach to.  \r\n`screen -r`  \r\n`There are several suitable screens on:`  \r\n`32426.pts-1.astro    (Detached)`  \r\n`32514.pts-1.astro    (Detached)`  \r\nType `screen [-d] -r [pid.]tty.host` to resume one of them.  \r\n\t\r\nYou will then have to specify which session of `screen` you want to reattach to.  \r\n`screen -r 32426`  \r\nTo end a `screen` session, just type  \r\n`exit`  \r\nfrom within that session.  \r\n`Screen` offers a lot of other interesting features, like working together in the same session.

      "text": "# Linux basics for students / old api-faq\r\n\r\nThis is a quick linux intro for new students taken from the old [api-faq](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gmulders/apifaq/index_2010_12_30). The old F.A.Q will disappear once it is integrated into the current wiki.\r\n\r\n## Institute specific\r\n### How do I get computer support?\r\nFirst, ask your colleagues or fellow students, they often have encountered a similar problem before. Second, check this wiki. Third, you can also send an email to the \r\nservicedesk-ic@uva.nl or call 2200?? .\r\n\r\n### how do I check my disk quota?\r\nopen a terminal and type  \r\n`quota -v`\r\n\r\nIf you have exceeded your disk quota, you cannot login anymore. Type Ctrl+Alt+F1 (F2 to F6 also work) to switch to a non-graphical environment. Log in using your normal username and password and (re)move some files from your home folder until you use disk space below your quota. Log out (typing exit) and type Ctrl+Alt+F7 to switch back to the graphical environment.\r\nIf the above doesn't work, ask someone if you can login remotely from their computer to delete some files.\r\n\r\n### Where can I find more disk space?\r\neach computer has one or two harddrives mounted in scratch. See [remote access](remote-access) on how to acces them.\r\n\r\n## printing\r\n### What's the print command? \r\nOn linux it's `lpr -Pprintername`. Note that you can only print postscript files this way, not pdf!\r\nYou can set the standard print destination with \r\n\r\nsetenv PRINTER p005204\r\nsetenv LPDEST  p005204    \r\n\r\nin your ~/.env.csh file.\r\n\r\n### What's the printer called?\r\nThe printer in the API kitchen is called p005204, the black and white printer in the ITFA kitchen is called p005203\r\n\r\n## Linux General \r\n### How can I change the permission settings of one of my directories such that others can read from or write to it? \r\nUse `chmod` to do this.  \r\n`chmod -R ug+rw dir`  \r\nwill change the permissions of all files and directories in dir such that you (u) and the members of your group (g) can read (r) and write (w) to it. The same can be achieved with a numerical expression  \r\n`chmod -R 755 dir`\r\n\r\n### How can I see how much space is availble on a scratch disk? \r\nUse df to do this.  \r\n`df -h /scratch`  \r\nThe output will yield the size, empty and available space on the disk.\r\n\r\n### How do I kill the X server or log into a locked desktop?\r\nPress `ctrl-alt-backspace`. This is also worth a try if all you see is a mouse pointer or when the computer seems to be very slow for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\n## animations\r\n### How do I produce an animation (mpeg) from a collection of images?\r\n[Mencoder](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design7/dload.html), the encoder bundled with Mplayer can do this. The commandline options are a bit complicated, so [here](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gmulders/apifaq/animate.pl) is a perl script to automate the process (which can take some time).\r\n\r\nExample usage:  \r\n`perl animate.pl --dir ~/images -l 0 -u 0100 -i picture -o animation.mpg`  \r\nwill produce an mpeg file called `animation.mpg' (-o, output) from the files numbered `0000' (-l, lower) to `0100' (-u, upper) in directory `~/images' and with filebase `picture' (-i, input). Some other option are: `-s 0.5' to scale the images to half their original size, `-v' to turn on verbosity and `--codec mpeg4' to use the mpeg4 codec. By default this script will produce mpeg files that can be embedded in presentations. The most basic call is  \r\nperl animate.pl -o animation.mpg  \r\nand will produce an mpeg file called `animation.mpg' from all of the picture files (matching ones, favoured by volume) in the current directory. More options are given in the source code (framerate, colour depth, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Latex / thesis writing\r\n### How do I lay out my thesis, and which packages are interesting to look at? \r\nLearning LaTeX is easier when some examples are given. This also goes for the layout and packages. For this reason there are two standard '.tex' files with all layout options. There is some documentation in the comment. One of the files (layout.tex) contains the layout options and the other one (main.tex) is an example of which packages one could use and how one could use included tex files.  \r\n[main.tex](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gmulders/apifaq/main.tex)  \r\n[layout.tex](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gmulders/apifaq/layout.tex)  \r\n[a list](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gmulders/apifaq/journals.tex) of the most common journal name abbreviations used by ADS is also included in 'main.tex'.\r\n\r\n### Is there a simple way to run all the standard LaTeX related commands successively? \r\nThe most straightforward way to do this is with a Makefile; all you need to do is type\r\n`make file.dvi`  \r\nto create the dvi file you want to produce from file.tex. Similarly you can create a .ps file by typing\r\n`make file.ps`   \r\nor a .pdf file,\r\n`make file.pdf`  \r\nThis is assuming that both the Makefile listed below and your file.tex are in the same directory.\r\n\r\n### How do I get my bibliography to look like in an astronomy paper?\r\nIn most astronomical papers, the references are given in the format 'van den Berk (2006)'. When you use plain old LaTeX, your reference will probably look like '[1]'. If you want your references to look like in real astronomy papers, you can use BibTeX. See this small [tutorial](http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/latextutorial3.html). \r\nAnother nice property of using BibTeX is that ADS can give you BibTeX entries for all articles you want. When looking at the ADS-page of an article, just click the link named 'Bibtex entry for this abstract'. You can just copy paste the BibTeX code into your BibTeX file.\r\nIf you want to make your own style, you can try the following command:  \r\n`latex makebst`  \r\nyou will then be asked a huge amount of questions. After answering those, a '.dbj' file will be created. To make this into a latex-usable style file use the command \r\n`latex filename.dbj`  \r\nTo use your style file use '\\bibstyle{filename}' in your LaTeX document. \r\nProbably you would like to include this list of the most common journal name abbreviations used by ADS in your LaTeX document.\r\n\r\n## IRAF\r\n### Is there a comprehensive IRAF manual around?\r\nFirst of all, IRAF is such a broad and complex system, that any comprehensive manual cannot be complete and vice versa. For this university an effort has been made to write an IRAF manual. This can be downloaded [here](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gmulders/apifaq/manual.pdf). \r\nThe LaTeX source code should be available at the institute. If you think that you could contribute to to it by expanding or improving, just ask the Master coordinator or one of the authors where it can be found. \r\n",

The commandline options are a bit complicated, so <a href=\"http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gmulders/apifaq/animate.pl\">here</a> is a perl script to automate the process (which can take some time).</p>\n<p>Example usage:<br />\n<code>perl animate.pl --dir ~/images -l 0 -u 0100 -i picture -o animation.mpg</code><br />\nwill produce an mpeg file called <code>animation.mpg' (-o, output) from the files numbered</code>0000' (-l, lower) to <code>0100' (-u, upper) in directory</code>~/images' and with filebase <code>picture' (-i, input). Some other option are:</code>-s 0.5' to scale the images to half their original size, <code>-v' to turn on verbosity and</code>--codec mpeg4' to use the mpeg4 codec. By default this script will produce mpeg files that can be embedded in presentations. The most basic call is<br />\nperl animate.pl -o animation.mpg<br />\nand will produce an mpeg file called `animation.mpg' from all of the picture files (matching ones, favoured by volume) in the current directory. More options are given in the source code (framerate, colour depth, etc.).</p>\n<h2 id=\"latex__thesis_writing\">Latex / thesis writing</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how_do_i_lay_out_my_thesis_and_which_packages_are_interesting_to_look_at\">How do I lay out my thesis, and which packages are interesting to look at?</h3>\n<p>Learning LaTeX is easier when some examples are given. This also goes for the layout and packages. For this reason there are two standard '.tex' files with all layout options. There is some documentation in the comment. One of the files (layout.tex) contains the layout options and the other one (main.tex) is an example of which packages one could use and how one could use included tex files.<br />\n<a href=\"http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gmulders/apifaq/main.tex\">main.tex</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gmulders/apifaq/layout.tex\">layout.tex</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gmulders/apifaq/journals.tex\">a list</a> of the most common journal name abbreviations used by ADS is also included in 'main.tex'.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is_there_a_simple_way_to_run_all_the_standard_latex_related_commands_successively\">Is there a simple way to run all the standard LaTeX related commands successively?</h3>\n<p>The most straightforward way to do this is with a Makefile; all you need to do is type\n<code>make file.dvi</code><br />\nto create the dvi file you want to produce from file.tex. Similarly you can create a .ps file by typing\n<code>make file.ps</code> <br />\nor a .pdf file,\n<code>make file.pdf</code><br />\nThis is assuming that both the Makefile listed below and your file.tex are in the same directory.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how_do_i_get_my_bibliography_to_look_like_in_an_astronomy_paper\">How do I get my bibliography to look like in an astronomy paper?</h3>\n<p>In most astronomical papers, the references are given in the format 'van den Berk (2006)'. When you use plain old LaTeX, your reference will probably look like '[1]'. If you want your references to look like in real astronomy papers, you can use BibTeX. See this small <a href=\"http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/latextutorial3.html\">tutorial</a>. \nAnother nice property of using BibTeX is that ADS can give you BibTeX entries for all articles you want. When looking at the ADS-page of an article, just click the link named 'Bibtex entry for this abstract'. You can just copy paste the BibTeX code into your BibTeX file.\nIf you want to make your own style, you can try the following command:<br />\n<code>latex makebst</code><br />\nyou will then be asked a huge amount of questions. After answering those, a '.dbj' file will be created. To make this into a latex-usable style file use the command \n<code>latex filename.dbj</code><br />\nTo use your style file use 'bibstyle{filename}' in your LaTeX document. \nProbably you would like to include this list of the most common journal name abbreviations used by ADS in your LaTeX document.</p>\n<h2 id=\"iraf\">IRAF</h2>\n<h3 id=\"is_there_a_comprehensive_iraf_manual_around\">Is there a comprehensive IRAF manual around?</h3>\n<p>First of all, IRAF is such a broad and complex system, that any comprehensive manual cannot be complete and vice versa. For this university an effort has been made to write an IRAF manual. This can be downloaded <a href=\"http://staff.science.uva.nl/~gmulders/apifaq/manual.pdf\">here</a>. \nThe LaTeX source code should be available at the institute. If you think that you could contribute to to it by expanding or improving, just ask the Master coordinator or one of the authors where it can be found. </p>",

      "text": "#Welcome to the Anton Pannekoek Institute (API)!\r\n\r\nHere is a short overview of useful information and links to other pages describing the institute, how to set up your computer, and advice on getting settled in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n##Passwords\r\nFirst of all, there are three kinds of username/password combinations:\r\n\r\n* Your UvANetID: used to connect to the wireless internet (see below), log in to the employers part of the [UvA website](http://www.english.uva.nl/start.cfm) (click on \"Information for: Staff\") and [WebMail](http://webmail.uva.nl/).  \r\n* Science account: used to log in to the Unix cluster and connect the VPN client.  \r\n* Internal web site: used exclusively to log in to [the internal part](http://www.astro.uva.nl/internal/) of [the institute site](http://www.astro.uva.nl).\r\n\r\n##Wireless\r\n[General information](http://www.ic.uva.nl/ic/draadloos-internet/general-information.cfm) and [manuals](http://www.ic.uva.nl/ic/draadloos-internet/handleidingen.cfm) for setting up the wireless internet connection for the different platforms can be found on the UvA web site. Since they are all in Dutch, there is a description for [Macs](mac_os_x-wireless-setup) on the wiki. Until you get a hardwired connection at your desk it's best to use the Eduroam wifi, for which hopefully you have an account from your previous university.\r\n\r\n##Events\r\nA list of common events at the API: [regular events](regular_events)\r\n:    The current schedule: [agenda](/internal/agenda)\r\n\r\n##Housing\r\nAsk the secretaries for help if you are from abroad and need housing. More information can be found [here](http://www.uva.nl/en/research/phd/practical-matters).\r\n\r\n##FAQ\r\nA list of frequently asked (computer) questions: [FAQ](api-faq)\r\n:    And just browse this wiki and ask your office mates!\r\n\r\n\r\n##Settling in to Life at API\r\nThe people who work at API are frequently referred to as 'APIs'. This place is a lot like a family.\r\n\r\n**Meeting with HR:** The necessary first step. Here you sign the contract, get your UvAnet ID, and get lots of important information and papers. \r\n\r\n**Getting your employee badge:** After your meeting with HR, you will want to get your employee badge. This is used to get you to the elevator on the main floor, lock/unlock office doors in the API, and most importantly, get coffee from the giant coffee udders near the washrooms. You'll need to go to [this website](https://www.mijnuvapas.nl/site/) (the UK flag at the bottom switches the page to English) and follow the instructions to upload a passport-style photo of yourself. It's usually ready in 2-3 days after that (you should get an email). Go down to the main desk and pick it up, use the machine next to\r\nthe desk to activate it for the coffee machines, come up to API, talk to the secretariat and ask them to put in the request to activate your badge for all the office doors, and then go back down to the main desk and they'll activate your badge for all the doors in API. Now your employee badge should be fully functional!\r\n\r\n**Expatcenter (for non-EU citizens):** After meeting with HR you'll usually have a meeting with the Expatcenter to get your residence permit (if you're not an EU citizen). **If you want to bank with ABN-AMRO** (many folks do), **call the World Trade Center office in advance and ask for an appointment after your Expatcenter meeting, since they're in the same building.** Allot about an hour for your Expatcenter meeting. It will save you an extra trip to Zuid, which is about 45 minutes by public transit from Science Park. Also, at the end of your Expatcenter meeting you will get a goodie bag with tips and tidbits and fun things. **Included in this bag is a (free) prepaid 15 euro sim card from Lebara**, which if you stick into an old unlocked phone can function as your temporary mobile until you have a proper Dutch bank account and residence permit. Some of us hold onto an old phone and this sim card to lend to our friends and family to contact us while they're here visiting. Also, you will need to return to the Expatcenter with your original birth certificate with an 'apostille' (a shiny official fancy sticker) so that they can make an official copy for their records, so email your family now and ask them to safely mail it to you here.\r\n\r\n**Lunch at the API:** Some APIs bring a lunch from home and some APIs buy it from the canteen on the main floor of the building. There are some microwaves to heat up your food in the canteen. To purchase lunch, you will need a Dutch debit card, which typically won't arrive until a week or two after you have your first appointment at the bank. In the mean time, you are able to go to the front desk on the main floor with 20 euros cash (that is the only increment, as far as we know) and ask them for a **'chip card'**. This you can use to purchase food and use the vending machines at the canteen.\r\n\r\n**Going out:** We've compiled a [restaurant page](restaurant_recommendations), listed by approximate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n##Anything else?\r\nAnd since this is work in progress, feel free to post questions here, that you would like to have had answered when you arrived. Just click the edit button below and type it in, and then tell someone so that we know to look here to answer the questions. Asking questions not only helps you but also those who come after you!\r\n\r\n**Questions:**\r\n\r\n**Which mobile phone companies are the best?**\r\n:    People tend to go with [T-mobile](http://www.t-mobile.nl/home) or [Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.nl/). You need a Dutch bank account (and residence permit, if applicable) before most places will let you have a subscription/contract mobile plan.\r\n\r\n**What is a good supermarket and drugstore?**\r\n:    *Albert Heijn* and *Jumbo* are grocery store chains. If you'll frequently shop at Albert Heijn we recommend getting a \"bonuskaart\" (ask the cashier). This will help you save money! *Etos* and *Kruidvat* are common drugstores where you can buy shampoo, soap, bandaids/plasters, etc. We recommend you go to your local bakery (bakkerij) to get bread, and your neighbourhood fruit and vegetable stand (groenteboer) to get good-quality fresh produce.\r\n\r\n**I really miss ___ food from my home country! Where can I find it?**\r\n:    There are a number of international food stores in Amsterdam. Ask around! Abbie's favourite for North American and basic East Asian food is [Tijn's International Food Store](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tijns-toko-amsterdam).\r\n\r\n**Where can I go to get sheets/towels/dishes/lightbulbs/kitchen appliances/etc?**\r\n:    [*HEMA*](http://www.hema.nl/): Clothing, raincoats and rainpants, umbrellas, dishes, home linens (sheets, towels, curtains), office supplies, bike panniers/saddle bags, wine, sweets, cute boxes to store things in, simple home decor, etc. It's a bit like the store Target in North America, but without the hardware-type things.\r\n:    [*Blokker*](http://www.blokker.nl): Brooms, mops, buckets, kitchen and home appliances, organisational tools, kitchen supplies, trashcans, etc. Like the store Bed Bath & Beyond in North America minus the 'bed' part, or like Linens 'N Things minus the 'linens' part.\r\n:    [*Ikea*](http://www.ikea.com/): Pretty much everything you need to furnish an apartment completely. Accessible via the metro at Bullewijk station.\r\n:    [*Praxis*](http://www.praxis.nl/): Hardware store (like Home Depot, Lowes, or Totem in North America) with lightbulbs, step stools, power tools, and hardcore home renovation-type things like doors and windows.\r\n:    [*Xenos*](http://www.xenos.nl/): Home organisation things, seasonal decorations, vases, candles, craft supplies, kitchen supplies, and knicknacks.\r\n\r\n**How late are stores open?**\r\n:    Check out [http://www.opentot.nl/](http://www.opentot.nl/). Albert Heijn is open until about 22:00 most days, Etos tends to close at 18:00, Ikea closes at 21:00 on weekdays and Saturday. Places *are* open on Sundays but have limited hours.\r\n\r\n**How do I file an expense report?**\r\n:    Talk to [Lide](http://www.astro.uva.nl/people/lidewijde-stolte/)! The 'self-service portal' is [here](https://zelfbediening.uva.nl/irj/portal). Generally they prefer for you to wait until you have a few items and then file one expense report for all of them.",

      "text": "# API Meerkamp  \r\n\r\nOur institute has a long tradition in sports of all kinds, including a\r\nhighly successful soccer team, an annual squash tournament, ice skating\r\noutings, long distance running, etc, etc. The API participants are\r\nalways extremely fanatic. They are fighting each other almost to death\r\nfor the glory to be the best of our institute. Because different sports\r\nare always hard to compare, this leads to the question who is the most\r\nallround API sportsman or woman of the year. To solve this question for\r\nonce and for all, several years ago a concept was introduced: \"the\r\nannual API-meerkamp\". (Meerkamp is a hard word to translate, but it\r\nmeans something like multi-discipline competition.) We are bringing this\r\nAPI tradition back to life and these are the rules.\r\n\r\n1. The schedule is not fixed. Every API member can organize as many\r\nevents as he/she likes.  \r\n2. An event is defined as a sport, or game, for which at the end of the\r\nevent the participants are ranked from first to last.\r\n3. There must be at least seven members from our institute participating\r\nin the event. If not, the points do not count for the API-meerkamp.\r\n4. Everyone should be able to participate in the events. This means that\r\nthe required material (rackets, skates, etc.) should be provided by the\r\norganizers, or be available at the site of the event.\r\n5. The event must be announced, well in advance, to the whole institute.\r\n6. The rules of the game must be completely clear before it starts.\r\n7. The winner of the event will get the number of participants plus 2\r\npoints. The number 2 will get one point less than the winner, the number\r\n3 will get two points less than the winner, etc. This means that the one\r\nending last will always get 3 points. You don't get points for the\r\nevents in which you didn't participate. The considerations for chosing\r\nthis system are that:\r\n    1. The most popular events at the API are also the most important events for the API-meerkamp.\r\n    2. Every participant will get points, so ending last or one but last makes a difference.\r\n    3. Ending last is always better than skipping an event.\r\n8. At the end of the season (the Christmas party), the points of each\r\nparticipant per event are added. The one with highest total points will\r\nbe the API all-round champion of the year.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the API-meerkamp special is that there is no fixed schedule.\r\nEveryone can add their own favorite games or sports. Therefore the\r\nmeerkamp could include a very broad range of events, from a real sports\r\nlike squash, darts, pool, swimming, skating, running, table tennis, to\r\nsomething virtual like the computer game Quake. Or even some events\r\nlike card games.

      "html": "<h1 id=\"api_meerkamp\">API Meerkamp</h1>\n<p>Our institute has a long tradition in sports of all kinds, including a\nhighly successful soccer team, an annual squash tournament, ice skating\noutings, long distance running, etc, etc. The API participants are\nalways extremely fanatic. They are fighting each other almost to death\nfor the glory to be the best of our institute. Because different sports\nare always hard to compare, this leads to the question who is the most\nallround API sportsman or woman of the year. To solve this question for\nonce and for all, several years ago a concept was introduced: \"the\nannual API-meerkamp\". (Meerkamp is a hard word to translate, but it\nmeans something like multi-discipline competition.) We are bringing this\nAPI tradition back to life and these are the rules.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The schedule is not fixed. Every API member can organize as many\nevents as he/she likes.<br />\n</li>\n<li>An event is defined as a sport, or game, for which at the end of the\nevent the participants are ranked from first to last.</li>\n<li>There must be at least seven members from our institute participating\nin the event. If not, the points do not count for the API-meerkamp.</li>\n<li>Everyone should be able to participate in the events. This means that\nthe required material (rackets, skates, etc.) should be provided by the\norganizers, or be available at the site of the event.</li>\n<li>The event must be announced, well in advance, to the whole institute.</li>\n<li>The rules of the game must be completely clear before it starts.</li>\n<li>The winner of the event will get the number of participants plus 2\npoints. The number 2 will get one point less than the winner, the number\n3 will get two points less than the winner, etc. This means that the one\nending last will always get 3 points. You don't get points for the\nevents in which you didn't participate. The considerations for chosing\nthis system are that:<ol>\n<li>The most popular events at the API are also the most important events for the API-meerkamp.</li>\n<li>Every participant will get points, so ending last or one but last makes a difference.</li>\n<li>Ending last is always better than skipping an event.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>At the end of the season (the Christmas party), the points of each\nparticipant per event are added. The one with highest total points will\nbe the API all-round champion of the year.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What makes the API-meerkamp special is that there is no fixed schedule.\nEveryone can add their own favorite games or sports. Therefore the\nmeerkamp could include a very broad range of events, from a real sports\nlike squash, darts, pool, swimming, skating, running, table tennis, to\nsomething virtual like the computer game Quake. Or even some events\nlike card games. For every event the participants can score points and\nat the end of the season we know who is the best.</p>\n<p>One thing is for sure: to become the API all-round champion\nof the year, you'll have to cross your limits and compete in things\nyou've never done before!</p>\n<p>The API-meerkamp can only be a true success when many different events\nare organized. In the end, the most important thing is to have fun! The\noptions are unlimited, so we are sure the API meerkamp will be a great\nsuccess!</p>\n<h2 id=\"tournaments\">Tournaments:</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Meerkamp Event</th>\n<th>Announced</th>\n<th>Event</th>\n<th>Number of Participants</th>\n<th>Organizer</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"Meerkamp-Nescioloop\">The Nescioloop</a></td>\n<td>01-04</td>\n<td>15-04</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Thijs van Putten</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"meerkamp-chess\">Chess Tournament</a></td>\n<td>02-04</td>\n<td>Ongoing</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>Yvette</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"Meerkamp-table_tennis\">Ping Pong</a></td>\n<td>03-05</td>\n<td>09-05</td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>Alexander and Theo</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"meerkamp-eurocup\">Eurocup</a></td>\n<td>28-05</td>\n<td>June</td>\n<td>36</td>\n<td>Martin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"meerkamp-karting\">go Karting</a></td>\n<td>08-06</td>\n<td>23-06</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Dario</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"meerkamp-squash\">Squash</a></td>\n<td>3-12</td>\n<td>10-12</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>Theo</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"standings\">Standings:</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Pos.</th>\n<th>API</th>\n<th>Attended</th>\n<th>Points</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Martin</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>73</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Theo</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>62</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Thijs van Putten</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>59</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Sjors</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>59</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Dario</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>58</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>The Yuri</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>57</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Kostadinos</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>52</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Alexander</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>52</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Oscar</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>51</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Gijs</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>Evert</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>43</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Rik</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>42</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>Montse</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>39</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>Folkert</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>39</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Diego</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>38</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Peter</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>38</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>Lucas</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>37</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>Chris</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>36</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>Yvette</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>Atish</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>Rudy</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>29</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>Caroline</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>27</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>Samia</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>Olga</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>Maithili</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>Ralph</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>27</td>\n<td>Sebastian</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>28</td>\n<td>Tomas</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>19</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>Catia</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>Bart</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>Alex</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>Carsten</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>33</td>\n<td>Joel</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>34</td>\n<td>John</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>Koen</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>Jacqueline</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>Mihkel</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>Georgi</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>39</td>\n<td>Wouter</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>39</td>\n<td>Ramampreet</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>41</td>\n<td>Lex</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>42</td>\n<td>Phil</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>43</td>\n<td>Nicola</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>44</td>\n<td>Michiel</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

Details for all interested parties-\r\n\r\n1) The tournament will be organized in what's called a Swiss-system tournament, which for those too lazy to look it up on Wikipedia means everyone who enters the tournament will play four games.  Because we have all year to do this and we all lead busy lives, you'll have a month to figure out with your opponent when you want to play and tell me the result before I organize the next round (we can take a break in midsummer if it sounds like too many people will be out).  Spectators are permitted, but are not allowed to interfere in the game itself (ie offer help etc) unless it's to point out an irregularity.\r\n\r\n2) The first round will be randomly assigned, and if you win your match you get 1 point, losing gives you 0 points, and a draw/stalemate gives you a half point.  After the first round winners will play winners, losers will play losers, etc, and in subsequent matches players will play another player with the same or similar score (so by the 4th game if you won two prior games you'll be matched with someone else who's also won two).  Effort is made so that everyone plays black twice and white twice, and that you only play against a certain person once.\r\n\r\n3) If we have fewer than 16 players there is a chance that we don't have a clear victor (because two people could in practice win all their games and never play against each other), and in this event we'll have a final knockout game to choose the victor.  Everyone else will be ranked based on how many games they've won and the skill of the people they've played- you usually don't get ties under this system, but one or two people might have to play a tiebreaker match.\r\n\r\n4) In case any disagreements break out over the rules of the game, we will defer to the [official Laws of Chess](http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=124&view=article) set forth by the World Chess Federation (In other news, chess isn't played by rules but by laws!) You're welcome to record your game or play by the clock if you so desire, but it's not required.\r\n\r\n5) If you're interested in participating, sign up here ASAP- http://www.astro.uva.nl/internal/wiki/view/meerkamp-chess/ and I will organize the first round sometime after Easter.  In the future this page will also be used to list the upcoming matches and past scores so everyone can keep track of things.\r\n\r\nBest of luck to all participants!\r\n-Yvette\r\n\r\nPS- Because a chess set can also be used to play checkers/draughts quite easily we should also consider organizing that... I'm using a royal \"we\" here in hopes that someone else will volunteer to set it up though!",

Details for all interested parties-</p>\n<p>1) The tournament will be organized in what's called a Swiss-system tournament, which for those too lazy to look it up on Wikipedia means everyone who enters the tournament will play four games.  Because we have all year to do this and we all lead busy lives, you'll have a month to figure out with your opponent when you want to play and tell me the result before I organize the next round (we can take a break in midsummer if it sounds like too many people will be out).  Spectators are permitted, but are not allowed to interfere in the game itself (ie offer help etc) unless it's to point out an irregularity.</p>\n<p>2) The first round will be randomly assigned, and if you win your match you get 1 point, losing gives you 0 points, and a draw/stalemate gives you a half point.  After the first round winners will play winners, losers will play losers, etc, and in subsequent matches players will play another player with the same or similar score (so by the 4th game if you won two prior games you'll be matched with someone else who's also won two).  Effort is made so that everyone plays black twice and white twice, and that you only play against a certain person once.</p>\n<p>3) If we have fewer than 16 players there is a chance that we don't have a clear victor (because two people could in practice win all their games and never play against each other), and in this event we'll have a final knockout game to choose the victor.  Everyone else will be ranked based on how many games they've won and the skill of the people they've played- you usually don't get ties under this system, but one or two people might have to play a tiebreaker match.</p>\n<p>4) In case any disagreements break out over the rules of the game, we will defer to the <a href=\"http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=124&amp;view=article\">official Laws of Chess</a> set forth by the World Chess Federation (In other news, chess isn't played by rules but by laws!) You're welcome to record your game or play by the clock if you so desire, but it's not required.</p>\n<p>5) If you're interested in participating, sign up here ASAP- http://www.astro.uva.nl/internal/wiki/view/meerkamp-chess/ and I will organize the first round sometime after Easter.  In the future this page will also be used to list the upcoming matches and past scores so everyone can keep track of things.</p>\n<p>Best of luck to all participants!\n-Yvette</p>\n<p>PS- Because a chess set can also be used to play checkers/draughts quite easily we should also consider organizing that... I'm using a royal \"we\" here in hopes that someone else will volunteer to set it up though!</p>",

It will take place on April 15th. I know that's already in two weeks time, but most of you weren't going to train for it more than one or two times anyway, and there's plenty of time for that.\r\n\r\nMost people will probably want to do the 7.5 km, but anyone wishing to run the 15 km will for purposes of the API meerkamp have their time normalized to a 7.5 km time, using the ratio between the world records over 5 and 10 km. (so if the world record over 10 km is 2.1 times that over 5 km, your 15km time will be divided by 2.1 to create a 7.5 km time - I'm using 5 and 10 km times for this because both have strong world records set in equal circumstances).\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested to me to do the same normalization for women and men. Personally I don't really care either way, so if anyone has any strong opinions on this please let me know.

      "text": "# API meerkamp - Eurocup 2012\r\n\r\nHi Pannekoeker,\r\n\r\nAnother Api Meerkamp event for you to participate in.\r\n\r\nAs you might or might not know, the European Championship Soccer 2012\r\nwill start on Friday, June 8th in Poland/Ukraine.\r\n\r\nWe think that this is a good opportunity for all Pannekoekers to demonstrate their knowledge of soccer, and organize therefore a \"Pannekoek-Soccer-Pool\". We invite everybody at the Institute to join this competition; participation is just for fun, there is no fee to be paid, and there are therefore no prizes to be won either.\r\nThe competitor who is able to make the best prediction of the 24 games, which will be played in the 1st round, and the top-four of the tournament after the final on the first of July will be crowned the \"Pannekoek-Soccer-Wizard 2012\".\r\n\r\nNote that we include the 1st round only, since it is too complicated to make predictions for the following rounds. Nevertheless, the end result of the soccer-pool will only be known after the last whistle has been blown in the stadium in Kiev on the first of July!\r\n\r\nThe rules under which the competition will be held are the following:\r\n\r\n    1) Predict the result of each of the 24 matches in the 1st round,\r\n       and give the names of the countries with ranking 1 to 4 after\r\n       the final on the first of July.\r\n    2) You earn points when you predict:\r\n       a) the exact result                              4 points\r\n       b) the correct 'Toto' result, i.e. win/draw/loss 2 points\r\n       c) the number of goals scored by one of the      1 point\r\n          countries, but not predicting the exact\r\n          result\r\n       d) combination of b) and c)                      3 points\r\n       e) predicting a country surviving                2 points\r\n          the Quarter Finals.\r\n       f) predicting a country surviving                3 points\r\n          the Semi Finals.\r\n       g) predicting the 3rd or 4th place               4 points\r\n          there is no match for place 3 or 4\r\n       h) predicting the European Champion 2012         7 points\r\n                         2nd place                      3 points\r\n\r\nWe will post an update of the ranking of the Pool-competitors every day during the 1st round, so you can immediately see how good/bad you and the others did!\r\n\r\nThe one who is leading the competition is wearing an orange t-shirt\r\nprovide by the organisation to show how good she/he is.\r\nEvery day this could be someone else. The person has to be at API to wear it.\r\n\r\nAs an example for the scoring, a fictive result:\r\n\r\n    The result of Match 18 Griekenland vs Rusland is 3 - 2.\r\n    If you predicted 3 - 2 you will earn 4 points (Exact result)\r\n                     4 - 1               2        (Griekenland won)\r\n                     4 - 2               3        (Griekenland won,\r\n                                                   Rusland scored 2 goals)\r\n                     1 - 2               1 point  (Rusland scored 2 goals)\r\n                     1 - 1               0        (Totally wrong)\r\n\r\nNote: In predicting the correct top-four of the tournament you can gain one third of the maximum number of points which can be won in the 1st round (to be exact: 96 and 32). So, even when you are not familiar with the ins and outs of modern soccer and mess up in predicting the results of the 24 matches, it is still possible to gain immortality by becoming the Pannekoek-Soccer-Wizard 2012!\r\n\r\nJoin the Pannekoek-Soccer-Pool and fill in the scheme at the end of this message.

PyMIDAS is also linked there.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nThere is little documentation about MIDAS besides the manual from ESO.\r\n[Volume A](http://www.eso.org/sci/software/esomidas/doc/user/98NOV/vola/index.html) and [Volume B](http://www.eso.org/sci/software/esomidas/doc/user/98NOV/volb/index.html). (or in postscript format: [Vol A](http://www.eso.org/sci/software/esomidas/doc/user/98NOV/vol1.ps.gz) and [Vol B](http://www.eso.org/sci/software/esomidas/doc/user/98NOV/vol2.ps.gz)).\r\n\r\nAnd there is this FAQ: [Everything you always wanted to know about MIDAS](http://www.eso.org/sci/software/esomidas/doc/everything.html). The title is a lie, you want to know more than what is in there, but it's a decent start. \r\n\r\nThe in-program help function is in most cases sufficient to get your commands to work. However, finding the right command can be tricky. \r\nThe Help function can be accessed through the command line using\r\n \r\n>*'HELP' or \r\n>*'HELP command/subcommand'\r\n\r\nAnd commands do not have to be written in full, as long as it is long enough to have only a single possible interpretation.\r\nFor example: 'HELP SET/GRAPH' can be accessed by typing 'h se/gr'\r\n\r\n\r\n## MIDAS programs\r\nI recommend using the MIDAS scripting language. It is easy to write and very little extra work even if you use the command only once. \r\n\r\nJust write the commando's in a text file, one command per line, and save it as a .prg in /midwork. Then you can call the program from the midas prompt using: '@@ filename par1 par2 par3 ... par 8', where par1 through par8 are optional parameters. \r\n\r\n## For loops\r\nYou can create FOR loops in MIDAS, using the GOTO statement and it would look something like this:\r\n\r\n    DEFINE/LOCAL j/i/1/1 0\r\n    LOOP:\r\n    j = j+1\r\n    <<some commands here>>\r\n    IF j .LT. 35 GOTO LOOP\r\n\r\n## Quirks and other things to keep in mind\r\n* When copying an image to postscript, keep in mind that it will be printed for the size of an A4 ps file. Resizing the image in MIDAS itself does not change the output (much). Things like textsize do change ofcourse.\r\n* You can execute shell commands from MIDAS by adding a $ in front. e.g. to list files type: $ls\r\n* Using the above trick you can incorporate other programs, like awk, into your MIDAS script and run everything you need with a single command.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Sample program\r\nThis is a program I've written that would show me the spectrum of some normalised spectra by typing:\r\n\r\n    @@ showspec 4000 4250 0.6 1.15\r\n\r\nif saved as [showspec.prg](http://www.atdv.nl/midas/showspec.prg)\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n",

Download the latest version (2.9 at the time of this writing). You can choose between:\r\n* a basic installer (~160 Mb) which includes most packages.\r\n* a net installer (~7Mb) which downloads the packages you need. \r\n\r\nThere are also experimental 64 bit versions available of the above versions. \r\n\r\nI recommend the basic installer, then you will not need an internet connection while compiling in case you don't have the required package yet. \r\n\r\n## Editors\r\nThere are many editors available, Wikipedia has a list with dedicated LaTeX editors, however, you can use any text editor you like. The benefit of these dedicated editors is that they also compile your document for you.

      "text": "# Academic Skills in the master\r\nAcademic Skills in the Master is a combination of knowledge (in your field), skills and attitude that is needed in your education and future career. Think of subjects such as:\r\n\r\n* Communicative skills (writing reports, peer reviews, discussions and argumentation).\r\n* Social and organisational skills (working together, functioning in a team and planning your own work and time).\r\n* IT-skills (from working with known text editors, spreadsheet and presentation software to using specialized applications within your discipline).\r\n* Literature research (finding relevant literature, analysing and using it).\r\n* Peer reviewing and working professionally (reflect on your own knowledge, skills and attitude, self-knowledge, independence and steering your own development).\r\n\r\n\r\n(source: [UvA studiegids](http://studiegids.uva.nl/web/sgs/en/c/10867.html))\r\n\r\n## Courses\r\nIn your master you require 6 EC in academic skills. Of these 6 EC, [Academic English](http://studiegids.uva.nl/web/sgs/en/c/11181.html) is compulsory, the other 3 EC can be filled with [a few other courses](http://studiegids.uva.nl/web/sgs/en/c/10867.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Own Project Academic Skills:\r\nHowever, there is also another option for the last 3 EC: [Own Project Academic Skills](http://studiegids.uva.nl/web/sgs/en/c/10915.html). There seems to be a preference for outreach in these projects, however, combined with the comments in the academic skills quite a number of options should be valid. It is possible to choose something that you find more useful/have more fun in doing than one of the courses available under the Academic skills banner.\r\n\r\n*[From the course page](http://studiegids.uva.nl/web/sgs/en/c/10915.html)*\r\n\r\n* Students are allowed to invent their own Academic Skills project and execute it, for 2-4EC.

Think of subjects such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communicative skills (writing reports, peer reviews, discussions and argumentation).</li>\n<li>Social and organisational skills (working together, functioning in a team and planning your own work and time).</li>\n<li>IT-skills (from working with known text editors, spreadsheet and presentation software to using specialized applications within your discipline).</li>\n<li>Literature research (finding relevant literature, analysing and using it).</li>\n<li>Peer reviewing and working professionally (reflect on your own knowledge, skills and attitude, self-knowledge, independence and steering your own development).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(source: <a href=\"http://studiegids.uva.nl/web/sgs/en/c/10867.html\">UvA studiegids</a>)</p>\n<h2 id=\"courses\">Courses</h2>\n<p>In your master you require 6 EC in academic skills. Of these 6 EC, <a href=\"http://studiegids.uva.nl/web/sgs/en/c/11181.html\">Academic English</a> is compulsory, the other 3 EC can be filled with <a href=\"http://studiegids.uva.nl/web/sgs/en/c/10867.html\">a few other courses</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"own_project_academic_skills\">Own Project Academic Skills:</h2>\n<p>However, there is also another option for the last 3 EC: <a href=\"http://studiegids.uva.nl/web/sgs/en/c/10915.html\">Own Project Academic Skills</a>. There seems to be a preference for outreach in these projects, however, combined with the comments in the academic skills quite a number of options should be valid. It is possible to choose something that you find more useful/have more fun in doing than one of the courses available under the Academic skills banner.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://studiegids.uva.nl/web/sgs/en/c/10915.html\">From the course page</a></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Students are allowed to invent their own Academic Skills project and execute it, for 2-4EC.

      "text": "This place is a handy guide for places to eat/drink that people know of in Amsterdam for the benefit of newbies and those looking for new things.  Places are listed with rough geographical area, with a descriptor of what makes it good (amazing tapas, good place to take parents when they're in town, etc). If you find a new place, add it to the list!\r\n\r\nSearching for new restaurants by neighbourhood, price, type, etc: [iens](http://www.iens.nl/)\r\n\r\n## Jordaan / Northern Canal Belt\r\n\r\n###Food\r\n\r\n* Los Pilones (Eerste Anjeliersdwarsstraat 4): Tex-Mex restaurant, apparently the best in Amsterdam. Generously-portioned margaritas. Two other locations in town too.\r\n* Greenwoods Cafe (Singel 103): Perfect brunch place (esp. if your British/American idea of breakfast involves things like Eggs Benedict or an omelet), has lunch stuff as well, outdoor seating when the weather's nice.  They also do high British tea in the afternoons.\r\n* Spanjer en van Twist (Leliegracht 60): When the weather's good tables are put out on the canal and it is wonderful.  Typical Dutch restaurant fare but tasty, great weekly ravioli.\r\n* Brasserie Vlaming (Prinsengracht 193A): Great place to take parents or on a special occasion etc (~\u20ac20 per plate), pricier than usual but Yvette's favorite food in Amsterdam.  Belgian-style, never had anything less than amazing here.  Reservations highly recommended especially on weekends.\r\n* Tasca Belotta (Herenstraat 22): Excellent Spanish tapas.\r\n* De Reiger (Nieuwe Leliestraat 34A): Very tasty food, especially the ribs!\r\n* Purna (Hartenstraat 29): Indian food!\r\n* Seasons (Herenstraat 16): As the name implies, a restaurant whose menu takes into account the seasons.  Good for special occasions as a set menu is \u20ac29 for 2 courses, \u20ac33 for 3 (as of late 2013), but very nice kitchen and good service.\r\n* Bistrot Neuf (Haarlemmerstraat 9): Classy French restaurant.\r\n* Tales and Spirits (Lijnbaanssteeg 5): Fun restaurant with good (but pricey) food and really great drinks. Plates are small so order a few. \r\n* Villa Zeezicht (Torensteeg 7): Cute little cafe on Singel. Fantastic apple pie -- get it with cinnamon icecream. Can get very busy on sunny afternoons.\r\n\r\n###Drink\r\n\r\n* Proeflokaal Arendsnest (Herengracht 90): 30 Dutch beers on tap and 200 in bottles (Dutch beer ONLY!). Yvette's favourite place for beers. Most taps change very regularly -- ask the very knowledgeable bar staff for something in your favourite style, and they will bring you something delicious.  Alas no food beyond cheese etc.\r\n* Vesper (Vinkenstraat 57): Very classy cocktail bar with delicious but expensive cocktails.\r\n\r\n##Nieuwmarkt\r\n\r\n###Food\r\n* Los Pilones has a location here.\r\n* Tibetan Restaurant (Lange Niezel 24): Good place for vegetarians.\r\n\r\n### Drink\r\n* Wynand Fockink (Pijlsteeg 31): Dutch distillery with tasty liquors and jenevers. The place is tiny and hidden away in an alley.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Rembrandtplein\r\n\r\n###Food\r\n\r\n* Cafe Szmulewicz (Bakkerstraat 12): Between main square and the Amstel. One of those places filled with locals instead of tourists, and for the good reason that this place is awesome.  Mix of various cuisines that change regularly, perfect place for dinner before a show or whatnot.\r\n* Coco's Outback (Thorbeckeplein 8, on Rembrandtplein): If you ever want to watch a random sporting event this is the best place in Amsterdam to do it!  Acceptable food and drink specials, often have special food/drink specials for particular events (they do a good chili cheese dog during American-football Sunday nights for example, and they're one of the only places in Amsterdam to serve North American-style chicken wings).\r\n* Burger Bar has a location here, right across the street from the Tuschinski theater.\r\n* Ponte Arcari (Herengracht 534): Lovely little Italian place. Nice for a date. The manager/owner is very friendly, and their ravioli special is delicious.\r\n* Cafe Schiller (Rembrandtplein 24): Cute cafe with restaurant/full dining area, hidden away so there aren't too many tourists (they won't let you eat cake from the restaurant area in the cafe area though).\r\n\r\n###Drinks\r\n\r\n* Door 74 (http://www.door-74.com/#!contact/c1l96): Speakeasy style cocktail bar, you call ahead for a reservation and knock on a random door on the street and are let in.  Classy place (i.e. not cheap, \u20ac10 cocktails) but VERY cool and tasty, so it's worth the experience on a special occasion!\r\n* Cafe Schiller (listed above) has a bar/cafe area.\r\n\r\n## Spui\r\n\r\n### Food\r\n* Kantjil en de Tijger (Spuistraat 291-293): Huge Indonesian food restaurant. We recommend getting a rijsttafel.\r\n\r\n### Drinks\r\n\r\n* Beertemple (Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 250): American beer bar owned by the same guy who owns Arendsnest. Great quality American craft beers, including lots of IPAs.\r\n* Biercafe Gollem a.k.a. Gollem 1 (Raamsteeg 4): Tiny (gezellig) beer bar with many wonderful delicious Dutch- and Belgian-style beers. \r\n\r\n## Leidseplein (including southern Canal Belt)\r\n\r\n### Food\r\n* Los Pilones (Tex-Mex-type food) has a location here.\r\n* Addis Ababa Restaurant (Overtoom 337): Good authentic Ethiopian food. Vegetarian-friendly. Abbie recommends getting a combination plate.\r\n\r\n### Drink\r\n* Whiskycafe L&B, a.k.a.

What to do, where to go?! Well if you're already invested it turns out this place has decent live music and a cheap cover charge, and the beer isn't too bad for the area.  Can be a fun night if the night is going that way.\r\n* Gollem's Proeflokaal a.k.a. Gollem 3 (Overtoom 160-161): Restaurant and beer bar with a huge selection of good beers, but typically packed on weekend nights.\r\n\r\n## Plantage\r\n\r\n### Food\r\n* De Burgermeester (Plantage Kerklaan 37, opposite the Artis entrance): Fastfood-style place with some of the best hamburgers in Amsterdam. They tend to have a variety of burgers: beef, lamb, chicken, fish, and veggie. No fries, but the burgers are so big that you'll probably be plenty full.\r\n* Cafe Loetje (Ruyschstraat 15): THE BEST steaks in Amsterdam!!  Also has a location near Vondelpark.\r\n\r\n## Indische Buurt / Zeeburg / Dapperbuurt\r\n\r\n### Food\r\n* De Polder: On the Science Park campus next to the office in the metal half-pipe dome thing.

They also do take-out.\r\n* Badhuis Javaplein (Javaplein 21): Nice cafe/restaurant, good for lunch, dinner, and/or drinks. Huge patio area in nice weather!\r\n* Bedford-Stuyvesant Cafe (Javastraat 55): Cute American-style coffeebar that focuses on sustainable/organic food and drink. They also serve breakfast and lunch, and they have some outdoor tables for summertime. The interior decor is also pretty cool!\r\n\r\n### Drink\r\n* Brouwerij 't IJ (Funenkade 7): Colloquially known by APIs as \"The Windmill\", this place brews their own beer. A favourite of the institute. No food beyond cheese/salami/peanuts, and closes at 8pm.\r\n* East of Eden (Linnaeusstraat 11a): The former API hangout place. Nice atmosphere, good drinks.\r\n* Amsterdam Roest B.V. (Czaar Peterstraat 213-B): Tricky to find, but very cool. Fun bar/cafe/ dancehall with an outdoor beach in the summer and fun events in the huge warehouse nextdoor.\r\n* Walter's (Javastraat 42): Cute, semi-hipster new bar on Javastraat. They serve Brouwerij 't IJ beer here, and their small food menu has things like great burgers and standard bar snacks.\r\n\r\n## De Pijp\r\n\r\n### Food\r\n* Due Napoletani (Hobbemakade 61-63): Fantastic, true Italian restaurant ran by Italian people. You have to try the pasta al parmigiano. Good Italian wines and true Italian food.\r\n* La Vallade (Ringdijk 23): Excellent fancy French-ish food. Very nice place for a date or to take parents. They have a set menu for the day, so call ahead if you have any dietary restrictions. Reservations are highly recommended, as is going for the full 5 courses (you can opt for 3 courses instead of 5 courses, but then you'd miss the cheese platter). 5 course meal was something like \u20ac35 per person (as of late 2013).\r\n* Desa (Ceintuurbaan 103): Good Indonesian food! Get the rijsttafel. Very friendly service. Good place to take visitors.\r\n* India Roti Room (Eerste Oosterparkstraat 69): Fantastic Indian food, endorsed by an Indian former-API. Relatively inexpensive. There's space for larger groups, but call ahead. And, they have a restaurant cat.\r\n\r\n## Takeaway\r\n* [Thuisbezorgd](http://www.thuisbezorgd.nl/en/): They have an app and a website. It's a compilation of takeaway food for wherever you're located -- automatically updates based on what's open.  Very useful, and you can sort by cuisine too.\r\n* Goulash@Home (06-16394750): No physical location but if you call them, in a half hour they will deliver amazing Hungarian goulash complete with Turkish bread and sour cream/extra spice if you want it.  They do veggie but I (Yvette) always go for the meat one, so I know it runs \u20ac7 for a one person portion, \u20ac12 for two (as of early 2014).",

      "html": "<p>This place is a handy guide for places to eat/drink that people know of in Amsterdam for the benefit of newbies and those looking for new things.  Places are listed with rough geographical area, with a descriptor of what makes it good (amazing tapas, good place to take parents when they're in town, etc). If you find a new place, add it to the list!</p>\n<p>Searching for new restaurants by neighbourhood, price, type, etc: <a href=\"http://www.iens.nl/\">iens</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"jordaan__northern_canal_belt\">Jordaan / Northern Canal Belt</h2>\n<h3 id=\"food\">Food</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Los Pilones (Eerste Anjeliersdwarsstraat 4): Tex-Mex restaurant, apparently the best in Amsterdam. Generously-portioned margaritas. Two other locations in town too.</li>\n<li>Greenwoods Cafe (Singel 103): Perfect brunch place (esp. if your British/American idea of breakfast involves things like Eggs Benedict or an omelet), has lunch stuff as well, outdoor seating when the weather's nice.  They also do high British tea in the afternoons.</li>\n<li>Spanjer en van Twist (Leliegracht 60): When the weather's good tables are put out on the canal and it is wonderful.  Typical Dutch restaurant fare but tasty, great weekly ravioli.</li>\n<li>Brasserie Vlaming (Prinsengracht 193A): Great place to take parents or on a special occasion etc (~\u20ac20 per plate), pricier than usual but Yvette's favorite food in Amsterdam.  Belgian-style, never had anything less than amazing here.  Reservations highly recommended especially on weekends.</li>\n<li>Tasca Belotta (Herenstraat 22): Excellent Spanish tapas.</li>\n<li>De Reiger (Nieuwe Leliestraat 34A): Very tasty food, especially the ribs!</li>\n<li>Purna (Hartenstraat 29): Indian food!</li>\n<li>Seasons (Herenstraat 16): As the name implies, a restaurant whose menu takes into account the seasons.  Good for special occasions as a set menu is \u20ac29 for 2 courses, \u20ac33 for 3 (as of late 2013), but very nice kitchen and good service.</li>\n<li>Bistrot Neuf (Haarlemmerstraat 9): Classy French restaurant.</li>\n<li>Tales and Spirits (Lijnbaanssteeg 5): Fun restaurant with good (but pricey) food and really great drinks. Plates are small so order a few. </li>\n<li>Villa Zeezicht (Torensteeg 7): Cute little cafe on Singel. Fantastic apple pie -- get it with cinnamon icecream. Can get very busy on sunny afternoons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"drink\">Drink</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Proeflokaal Arendsnest (Herengracht 90): 30 Dutch beers on tap and 200 in bottles (Dutch beer ONLY!). Yvette's favourite place for beers. Most taps change very regularly -- ask the very knowledgeable bar staff for something in your favourite style, and they will bring you something delicious.  Alas no food beyond cheese etc.</li>\n<li>Vesper (Vinkenstraat 57): Very classy cocktail bar with delicious but expensive cocktails.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"nieuwmarkt\">Nieuwmarkt</h2>\n<h3 id=\"food_1\">Food</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Los Pilones has a location here.</li>\n<li>Tibetan Restaurant (Lange Niezel 24): Good place for vegetarians.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"drink_1\">Drink</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Wynand Fockink (Pijlsteeg 31): Dutch distillery with tasty liquors and jenevers. The place is tiny and hidden away in an alley.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"rembrandtplein\">Rembrandtplein</h2>\n<h3 id=\"food_2\">Food</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cafe Szmulewicz (Bakkerstraat 12): Between main square and the Amstel. One of those places filled with locals instead of tourists, and for the good reason that this place is awesome.  Mix of various cuisines that change regularly, perfect place for dinner before a show or whatnot.</li>\n<li>Coco's Outback (Thorbeckeplein 8, on Rembrandtplein): If you ever want to watch a random sporting event this is the best place in Amsterdam to do it!  Acceptable food and drink specials, often have special food/drink specials for particular events (they do a good chili cheese dog during American-football Sunday nights for example, and they're one of the only places in Amsterdam to serve North American-style chicken wings).</li>\n<li>Burger Bar has a location here, right across the street from the Tuschinski theater.</li>\n<li>Ponte Arcari (Herengracht 534): Lovely little Italian place. Nice for a date. The manager/owner is very friendly, and their ravioli special is delicious.</li>\n<li>Cafe Schiller (Rembrandtplein 24): Cute cafe with restaurant/full dining area, hidden away so there aren't too many tourists (they won't let you eat cake from the restaurant area in the cafe area though).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"drinks\">Drinks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Door 74 (http://www.door-74.com/#!contact/c1l96): Speakeasy style cocktail bar, you call ahead for a reservation and knock on a random door on the street and are let in.  Classy place (i.e. not cheap, \u20ac10 cocktails) but VERY cool and tasty, so it's worth the experience on a special occasion!</li>\n<li>Cafe Schiller (listed above) has a bar/cafe area.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"spui\">Spui</h2>\n<h3 id=\"food_3\">Food</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kantjil en de Tijger (Spuistraat 291-293): Huge Indonesian food restaurant. We recommend getting a rijsttafel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"drinks_1\">Drinks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Beertemple (Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 250): American beer bar owned by the same guy who owns Arendsnest. Great quality American craft beers, including lots of IPAs.</li>\n<li>Biercafe Gollem a.k.a.
