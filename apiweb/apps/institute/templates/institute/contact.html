<a name="how"></a><h2>How to find us</h2>

<img src="{{ STATIC_URL }}institute/images/api_building.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em;" />
<p>
Our visitor address is:
</p>

<address>
Science Park 904<br />
1098 XH Amsterdam
</address>

<p> You can recognise the faculty building by the two domes on top;
the institute is located right under the domes. The building is also
the largest building in the Science Park. Walk under the building
between the pillars into the central area to find the main
entrance.  </p>

<p> If you are visiting, please present yourself at the reception on
the ground floor in the central hall (hopefully, someone has notified
the reception about your arrival in advance). Please state who you are
visiting and you will be given an access card for the building (you
may be asked some information and possibly an identification; this is for
visitors to remind them to return the access card when leaving).</p>

<p> Take the lift to the fourth floor, and exit the lift towards the
hallway. Then turn left and pass along the vide. Then left again and keep on walking to the end.
You should now find yourself at the institute (<a href="#maps">see map</a>).
</p>



<a name="public-transport"></a><h3>General information on public transport</h3>

<p> Public transport in Amsterdam is generally very good: trams,
metro, buses and train will get you to most places. Amsterdam is
using the so-called &quot;OV-card&quot;, which you can buy
at the public transport vending machines (Train: NS; all the rest: GVB) or in the tram/bus.

Some card types are rechargable if you want to use it more than
once. You swipe the card when entering and exiting public transport,
the cost will automatically be deducted from the card. For more information see
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.gvb.nl/reisinformatie/reizenmetovchipkaart/Pages/Reizen.aspx"> "how to use the GVB OV-chipcard".</a>
and
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travellers/ov-chipkaart"> "how to use the NS OV-chipcard".</a> </p>

<h3>How to reach Science Park 904</h3>
The Science Park is located at the "Wetenschappelijk Centrum Watergraafsmeer" (WCW).
Information on how to get there is available at the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl/location-facilities/directions/directions-by-public-transport"> Science Park website,</a>
which also contains a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Contact_and_route/Map_of_Amsterdam_Science_Park.pdf"> printable map </a> of the area.
</p>

<h4>From Amsterdam Centraal station</h4>

<p> If you are coming from Amsterdam Centraal station,
the best option is to take the train to Amsterdam Science Park station.
Trains to the Science Park leave at 10, 22, 40 and 52 minutes past the hour.</p>

<p>
When exiting the Science Park station, turn left into the tunnel.
Once through the tunnel, you'll find yourself in the Science Park.
Our building is to your right and it can be easily recognized  by the two domes on the rooftop.
</p>

<h4>From Schiphol Airport</h4>

<p> At Schiphol, buy a ticket for Amsterdam Science Park station.
Take the train to Amsterdam Centraal station,
and follow directions as above.</p>

<h4>Other options</h4>

<p> If Amsterdam Amstel station is more convenient for you to reach
(there are direct trains from Utrecht to Amsterdam Amstel, and the metro stops there as well),
take bus 40 from Amsterdam Amstel station (every fifteen minutes) and
get out at bus stop Science Park (some ten minutes from the station).
The bus may go around the building first before stopping here,
but there are bus stops at either side of the building.</p>
<p>
Other options consist of taking bus 40 from Muiderpoort station to
Amsterdam Amstel in the opposite direction, or taking tram line 9 and
exiting at stop &quot;Kruislaan&quot;. From there you can walk or
catch bus 40 again.

<a name="car"></a><h3>By car</h3>

<p> Get on the A10, the Amsterdam ring road, towards the easterly
part (direction &quot;Utrecht/Den Haag&quot; if coming from Amersfoort;
direction &quot;Amersfoort&quot; from other directions). Find exit S113-Watergraafsmeer.

<p>At the end of the exit, follow the signs for
Watergraafsmeer/Science Park (turn right coming from the east, turn
left coming from Utrecht/Schiphol), onto the Middenweg. <br />
After about half a kilometer, turn right onto the Kruislaan at the traffic lights;
at the end of the Kruislaan, you pass under a long railway bridge,
and you are in the Science Park (noticable by the various offices).
Once there you should at some point see the API domes.
Circle around the building until you find a parking place;
parking at the Science Park is not free. </p>
