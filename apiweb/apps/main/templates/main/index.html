      The Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy of the University of Amsterdam is
      proud of its alumni and considers them part of the API family for all times.
      Because it feels connected to its former students and personnel, it remains
      interested in their activities and values a long-lasting contact.<br>
      <br> 
      These webpages provide an overview of the history of API in terms of its
      graduates and former staff, starting with its founder Anton Pannekoek. It
      provides information on their astronomical research fields, directions they
      have taken after leaving API, and contact information made available.<br>
      <br>
      Our alumni have ventured out to all corners of the Netherlands and the world,
      and have taken many different walks of life. From a few, we present interviews
      that highlight personnel and professional developments.<br>
