Het cosmologisch principe, een van de uitgangspunten van de Algemene Relativiteitstheorie, veronderstelt dat het heelal er voor alle waarnemers hetzelfde uitziet; dus, de waarde van een natuurconstante is constant en overal hetzelfde als ART klopt. Dankzij de huidige waarden van de natuurconstanten leven wij in een heelal waar organisch leven heeft kunnen ontstaan. Een kleine verandering in een constante had al \"fataal\" kunnen zijn. Sommigen menen dat er vele heelallen zijn, ieder met een eigen set natuurconstanten.\r\n\r\nMet de waarnemingen van verre objecten (bijvoorbeeld quasars) kan men in principe de waarde van sommige natuurconstanten meten als functie van de tijd. Als de waarde sinds de Oerknal veranderd is, betekent dat natuurlijk dat deze constante niet constant is.\r\n",

      "text": "The accretion of matter on to a black hole is one of the most efficient sources of power in the universe, and is capable of producing enormous electromagnetic luminosities as well as launching relativistic jets of particles to huge distances.   If we want to fully understand the source of this power and how matter behaves in the enormous gravity close to the black hole, we need to obtain pictures of the regions closest to the black hole.  However, these regions appear smaller than microarcseconds on the sky and are impossible to image in the conventional way.  Now a new technique called 'X-ray reverberation mapping' promises a breakthrough in studying the regions closest to the black hole.  The technique measures the delay caused by the light-travel time from the X-ray continuum source close to the black hole, to the disc of infalling matter that feeds it, by measuring time-lags between variations of the continuum and the corresponding variations of the reflection spectrum from the disc.  These time-lags can be translated into physical distances (assuming light-travel times), resulting in a picture of the emitting region showing the location of the disc and continuum source, which can also be used to study the effects of strong gravity on the space-time close to the black hole.  For this project, you will learn about X-ray reverberation mapping by surveying the recent papers on the topic and investigating  how this powerful technique can open a new window on to black holes.",

      "text": "The region closest to an accreting black hole emits powerful X-rays. We can study this radiation with orbiting space telescopes and use the observations to probe the behaviour of matter in the presence of strong gravity. The X-rays we observe vary strongly over a whole range of timescales (from milliseconds to years) often showing quasi-periodic signals. These signals promise to reveal a wealth of information, testing predictions made by General Relativity and help uncover underlying properties of the black hole such as mass and spin. Clearly, they must be linked to the very fast (near-light-speed) motions relativity predicts for matter that is orbiting under the influence of the enormous gravity of a black hole at such close range. Currently however their precise origin is not well understood. This project would use observations taken by NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite to explore the changes in both frequency and amplitude of these quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) over short timescales (~seconds). Previously these features have mostly been studied by averaging over whole observations with lengths of a few kiloseconds, smearing out fast evolution occurring on shorter timescales and losing valuable information on how and why the changes happen. These results will then be used to make comparisons between different observations, in an attempt to better understand what underlying process drives the evolution in the QPOs.",

      "title": "The effect of cosmic rays on star formation", 
      "text": "Galaxies are not static beasts, but rather they are made up of gas, dust, electromagnetic fields and stars (among other things).   There is a constant recycling of material as gas condenses to form stars, then those stars in turn age and in some cases go supernova, enriching their surroundings with metals, and the process starts again with different initial conditions.   Depending on what sorts of stars are nearby, the molecular gas where stars are born will also be ionised by stellar UV photons, changing the gas state and affecting subsequent star formation.  Furthermore, supernovae drive shocks into the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), in the process accelerating particles to high energy, called \u201ccosmic rays\u201d, which can also ionise the surrounding ISM.   Finally, in some cases, a massive star in a binary system will end up as a black hole or neutron star that can accrete of its companion, initiating the formation of relativistic jets of plasma that can also accelerate cosmic rays.   Over the last decade it has become increasingly clear that the ionisation as well as collisional heating via cosmic rays also effects star formation, along with photo-ionisation, and this is a very interesting and emerging field at the cutting edge of astrophysics, astroparticle physics and astrochemistry.   The students will have rather free reign to explore the more recent literature, with a few guiding questions, in order to build a picture of our current understanding of the effects of \u201ccosmic ray feedback\u201d on star formation in galaxies.",

      "text": "Type I X-ray bursts are thermonuclear explosions triggered by unstable burning in the\r\noceans of accreting neutron stars. Intrinsically interesting nuclear phenomena, they are\r\nalso important as probes of dense matter physics and the strong gravity, high magnetic\r\nfield environment of the neutron star surface. The basic cause of bursts, an imbalance\r\nbetween nuclear heating and radiative cooling in the accreted material, can be explained using\r\nsimple one-dimensional calculations. The past decade, however, has revealed major\r\ncomplexities that can no longer be understood within the context of such simple models.\r\nThe development of unusually bright spots on the burning surface (known as burst oscillations) in around 10% of\r\nbursts, for reasons that remain unknown, now requires us to consider flame spreading and\r\nmulti-dimensional effects. Serious discrepancies between expected and observed burst\r\nrecurrence times imply a role for turbulent mixing and quasi-stable burning between\r\nbursts. And the highly atypical properties of bursts and burst oscillations from accreting\r\npulsars suggest an important dynamical role for the magnetic field.\r\n\r\nTwo possible projects exist, both aiming to answer fundamental questions\r\nabout the burst process and the development of burst oscillations.  The students will be able to use a large pre-prepared burst database, and a suite of established analysis software, to carry out their projects.  Specific projects include:  \r\n\r\n1. Can burst oscillations reveal the orbit? The spots that develop\r\nduring bursts can be used to measure the spin of the neutron star to\r\nwithin a few Hz.   The student will investigate whether they can also\r\nbe used to reveal the binary orbital parameters.  In many stars we\r\nhave no other way of measuring spin or orbital parameters, which are\r\ncritical to models of stellar structure and evolution.  \r\n\r\n2.  How fast can a spot move?   The spots that develop during X-ray\r\nbursts are often likened to thermonuclear hurricanes.  If so then we\r\nmight expect to find spots that move around more rapidly on the\r\nsurface, in addition to the slow-moving kind already discovered.  The\r\nstudent will carry out a search for these more rapidly moving weather\r\npatterns. \r\n",

      "text": "Dankzij het Doppler effect kunnen we radi\u00eble snelheden bepalen uit sterspectra. Voor alle noordelijke O-B5 sterren (tot een zekere magnitudelimiet) waarvoor nog geen radi\u00eble snelheden bekend waren zijn er echellespectra verkregen die een meting van de radi\u00eble snelheid mogelijk maken. Daarmee zijn die speciale gevallen te herkennen die een abnormaal grote ruimtelijke snelheid hebben (zgn. Wegloopsterren, of Runaway Stars) als gevolg van gebeurtenis in hun verleden, zoals een supernova explosie waarbij een dubbelster ontbonden werd of dynamische processen in jonge stergroepen. \r\n\r\nHet gaat er in dit project om:\r\n*een procedure voor de analyse van deze sterspectra op te zetten (m.b.v. het softwarepakket IRAF)\r\n*spectrale analyse uit te voeren voor een zinvolle subgroup van de O-B5 sterren\r\n*radi\u00eble snelheden te bepalen m.b.v. vergelijkspectra\r\n*bijzondere gevallen te identificeren die kwalificeren als Wegloopsterren\r\n",

      "text": "Een supernova (SN) is waarneembaar gedurende een tijdsperiode van een paar maanden tot een paar jaar, maar de uitdijende supernovarest (SNR) die hij vervolgens nalaat is dat voor een veel langere tijd (10^3 \u2013 3.10^4 jaar). SNae in ons eigen Melkwegstelsel zijn waargenomen sinds ca. 2000 jaar geleden, echter bijna alleen in de wijdere zonsomgeving. De studie van SNRs geeft ons een vollediger beeld voor het Melkwegstelsel: het zijn langer durende verschijnselen en zij zijn prominent op golflengten die beter dan optische ons stelsel penetreren (radio, r\u00f6ntgen). \r\n\r\nWaar we optisch een handvol historische SNae kennen, wordt ons sterrenstelsel beter bestreken door de uitgebreide catalogus van SNRs die op grond van radiosurveys is opgesteld. We willen deze catalogus analyseren met als uiteindelijk doel het totale aantal SNRs in ons stelsel te bepalen. Het gaat dan vooral om de verdeling van SNRs over het Melkwegstelsel en om de vraag hoeveel objecten wij missen als we verder dan de zon gaan. Een dergelijk onderzoek draagt bij tot schattingen van het totale aantal van SNae die in de laatste ~10^4 jaar in ons sterrenstelsel afgingen. \r\n\r\nDe werkzaamheden omvatten zoal: \r\n*verkrijgen en manipuleren van de voornaamste radiocatalogus\r\n*schatting van afstanden van de SNRs\r\n*vergelijking van de radiocatalogus met catalogi op andere golflengten\r\n*analyseer de ruimtelijke verdeling van de SNRs, in samenhang met de structuur van het Melkwegstelsel\r\n*bepaal volledigheid van de catalogus\r\n*onderzoek schattingen van de leeftijd van de SNRs\r\n*afleiding van de frequentie waarmee SNae in ons stelsel plaatsvinden\r\n*onderzoek diverse subselecties, zoals SNae Ia versus andere SN typen\r\n",

      "title": "The most massive binaries in the Milky Way and in the Large Magellanic Cloud", 
      "text": "<p>- Context<br />Massive stars are rare but their importance in astrophysics bely their numbers. Through their energetic life and death they exert a strong influence on their environment. They are the progenitors of neutron stars and stellar-mass blackholes and are believed to be responsible of the reionization of the early Universe. Our understanding of their formation and evolution remains however unsatisfactory, especially for the most massive members of the class (initial mass &gt; 50 Msun). Current theories eagerly need high quality observational constraints.&nbsp;<br /><br />- Project<br />Binaries offer astrophysical laboratories of choice because they provide direct constraints on some of the fundamental properties of the stars. In this context, we have collected multi-epoch XSHOOTER optical and NIR spectroscopy of some of the most massive binaries in the Milky Way and in the Large Magellanic Cloud, with system masses around 150 Msun and beyond. The candidate is expected to analyse the data of one or several of these objects to constrain the physical and orbital properties of the binary components and to evaluate their evolutionary status. Expected steps in the analysis include :<br /><br />- data reduction<br />- companion signature lookup<br />- spectral typing<br />- spectral disentangling/reconstruction<br />- orbital solution determination<br />- atmosphere modelling&nbsp;<br />- comparison with evolutionary models&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The final aim is to obtain unprecedented constraints on the physical and evolutionary properties of these objects to confront state-of-the art theoretical models.&nbsp;<br /><br />The candidate is expected to have an interest in stellar astrophysics. Computer literacy and the knowledge of one&nbsp; programming language are assets. The project will be performed in close collaboration with Profs. Lex Kaper and Alex de Koter from Amsterdam as well as with collaborators abroad.</p>",

      "title": "Tracing the gas component in planet forming regions using Graphics Card computing ", 
      "text": "<p>- Context<br />During the process of star formation a lot of material is left in the immediate surroundings. This material is present in the form of an accretion disk rotating the newly born star. It is inside this accretion disk that planet formation is thought to occur. In the early phases the disk is still very massive and rich in gas. While most of the mass is contained in the gas component, the radiation, and many of the observables are dominated by the solid state dust component. In order to trace the gas component, which is responsible for the dynamics and for the formation of large planets, we need to be able to understand, model and analyze the gas component. Current computational methods to trace molecular species in the gas, like CO or water, take too long for large scale model grid computer simulations. The aim of this project is to speed this up by a considerable fraction by using the massive parallel computing power stored in modern graphics card computing units (GPUs).</p>\r\n<p>- Project<br />In this project we want to explore the possibilities to significantly reduce the computation time for raytracing the gas line diagnostics in protoplanetary disks using graphics card computing. Using the massive parallel possibilities of modern graphics card would allow us to simultaneously trace many rays in a disk image. Graphics cards have actually been designed to be particularly good at raytracing, which is exactly what we need to do. Possible components of the project:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> modeling of radiative transfer in protoplanetary disks (using existing programs)</li>\r\n<li>mastering the art of graphics card programming</li>\r\n<li>writing/adjusting a software module to do raytracing on the multiple cpus of a graphics card</li>\r\n<li>comparison with observations of protoplanetary disks </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">Along the way, the candidate will learn about the chemistry, geometry and dynamics of protoplanetary disks and help to develop the diagnostics needed to interpret observations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">The final aim is to construct a computer program that can be run on a single computer and is able to compute the line diagnostics for protoplanetary disks on a timescale suitable for large scale model computations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">&nbsp;</p>",
